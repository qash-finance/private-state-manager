//! Background reconciliation of recoverable deltas (issue #345).
//!
//! Recoverable rows — `retained` deltas and recent client-abandoned
//! discards (the late-landing net for issue #319's abandon quarantine) —
//! are swept by a dedicated [`ProcessingMode::ReconcileRecoverable`]
//! pass, on its own cadence, never inside the full candidate pass. The
//! sweep is account-oriented and cheap by construction:
//!
//! 1. Expired retained rows are dropped first, without network work.
//! 2. One chain probe per due account decides everything else: if the
//!    chain still sits at the stored base, nothing can have landed and
//!    no reconstruction runs at all.
//! 3. Only when the chain moved past the stored base is the matching
//!    row — located via its submission-computed `new_commitment` —
//!    reconstructed and validated before the fenced promotion.
//!
//! Accounts are additionally backed off as their recoverable rows age
//! (see [`reconcile_backoff_seconds`]), and one pass visits at most
//! `reconcile_page_size` accounts under a rotation cursor, so a
//! correlated backlog (e.g. after a node outage) drains across passes
//! instead of thundering back all at once.
