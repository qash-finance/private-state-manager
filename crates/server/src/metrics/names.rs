//! Metric name and label taxonomy for the Prometheus integration.
//!
//! Every metric the server emits is declared in [`REGISTRY`], which is
//! the single source of truth consumed by both the recorder (to attach
//! help text) and the cardinality unit tests (to enforce the label
//! allowlist). Naming follows the Prometheus conventions: `guardian_`
//! namespace, seconds as the base unit, `_total` suffix on counters.
//!
//! Cardinality policy: every label key must appear in
//! [`LABEL_ALLOWLIST`] and every label value must come from a bounded
//! set — route templates (never raw paths), gRPC method names from the
//! proto definition, static operation names, and small closed enums.
//! Account IDs, nonces, commitments, pubkeys, client IPs, and error
//! strings must never become label values.
//!
//! Downstream consumers re-list parts of this taxonomy and do not track
//! it automatically: the CloudWatch export allowlist in
//! `infra/observability.tf` (metrics absent there never reach
//! CloudWatch) and the Grafana dashboard in
//! `docs/guides/observability/grafana/dashboards/guardian.json`. Adding
//! or renaming a metric here means revisiting both.
