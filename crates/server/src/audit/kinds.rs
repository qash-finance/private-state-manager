//! Stable `action_kind` vocabulary for the `admin_actions` audit trail.
//!
//! One central registry per feature 006-operator-authz §FR-024. Consumer
//! features add their own consts here. The audit table column is TEXT
//! and the writer accepts any string, but production code MUST use one
//! of these consts so a `git log -p audit/kinds.rs` shows the complete
//! audit-vocabulary history.

/// Authorization middleware rejected a request because the
/// authenticated operator lacked one or more required permissions.
/// `payload` carries `{ route_path, http_method, required_permissions }`
/// (FR-025); `target_account_id` is NULL.
pub const AUTH_DENIED: &str = "auth.denied";

/// Authorization-middleware probe endpoint was hit successfully. Test
/// surface only — the probe is behind the `authz-test-probe` Cargo feature
/// and never reaches production builds. `payload` is `{}`.
pub const PROBE_ACCESS: &str = "probe.access";

/// Operator paused an account. `payload` carries
/// `{ before_state, after_state, reason }`; `target_account_id` is set.

/// Operator unpaused (or attempted to unpause an already-active)
/// account. `payload` carries `{ before_state, after_state, reason }`;
/// `target_account_id` is set.

/// new consts above and add them to this slice in the same commit.
