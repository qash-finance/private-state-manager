-- Reverse of 2026-07-23-000001_retained_delta_status.
-- Retained rows are best-effort recovery artifacts, never settled
-- history, so dropping them (the pre-#345 delete behavior) is the
-- correct rollback — the tightened CHECK could not be restored while
-- any remain. The narrowed constraint is added NOT VALID for the same
-- metadata-only-switch reason as in up.sql: with the retained rows
-- deleted in this very transaction, every remaining row is provably
-- valid, and skipping validation avoids a full-table scan under
-- ACCESS EXCLUSIVE.
