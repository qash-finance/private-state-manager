-- Collapse per-(account, signer) replay state back to one per-account row.
-- MAX over the account's signers is the conservative account-scoped floor:
-- no request accepted under per-signer scope wins the account-scoped CAS
-- after the rollback. Same locking rationale as up.sql: post-#367 CAS
-- writers are blocked so their timestamps land in the aggregate; once the
-- rebuild commits, queued per-signer writes fail on the missing column,
-- which is the intended fail-closed behavior.
