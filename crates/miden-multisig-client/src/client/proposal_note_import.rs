//! Recovery primitives for MultisigClient.
//!
//! After key-based recovery the local Miden store starts empty, so notes the
//! account was in the middle of consuming are gone. v2 `consume_notes`
//! proposals embed the serialized notes they consume, which makes
//! pending proposals opportunistic recovery material: this module rebuilds
//! importable notes from those embedded bytes plus a node-fetched inclusion
//! proof, without needing the node to hold the note body — so it works for
//! private notes too.
