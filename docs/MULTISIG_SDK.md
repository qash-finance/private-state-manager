## Quick Start

### Installation

The multisig sdk has as peer dependency on the miden-sdk, you will need to install both.

**TypeScript (npm)**
```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client @miden-sdk/miden-sdk@0.16.0
```

**Rust (Cargo.toml)**
```toml
[dependencies]
miden-multisig-client = "0.17.0"
miden-client = "=0.16.0"
```

### 5-Minute Example

Create a 1-of-3 multisig account, propose a transfer, collect signatures, and execute.

#### TypeScript

```typescript
import { MidenClient, AuthSecretKey } from '@miden-sdk/miden-sdk';
import { MultisigClient, FalconSigner } from '@openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client';

// 1. Setup clients
const midenClient = await MidenClient.createDevnet();
const secretKey = AuthSecretKey.rpoFalconWithRNG(undefined);
const signer = new FalconSigner(secretKey);
const client = new MultisigClient(midenClient, {
  guardianEndpoint: 'http://localhost:3000',
  midenRpcEndpoint: 'https://rpc.devnet.miden.io',
});
// Both endpoints are required; construction throws when either is omitted.
// midenRpcEndpoint must point at the same network as the injected MidenClient.

// 2. Get GUARDIAN server public key
const guardianCommitment = await client.guardianClient.getPubkey();

// 3. Create 1-of-3 multisig account
const config = {
  threshold: 1,
  signerCommitments: [signer.commitment, cosigner1Commitment, cosigner2Commitment],
  guardianCommitment,
};
const multisig = await client.create(config, signer);
await multisig.registerOnGuardian();

console.log('Account created:', multisig.accountId);

// 4. Create a transfer proposal
const proposal = await multisig.createP2idProposal(
  recipientAccountId,
  faucetAccountId,
  1000n  // amount
);

console.log('Proposal created:', proposal.id);

// 5. Cosigners sign (only one cosigner is needed)
await multisig.signProposal(proposal.id);

// 6. Execute when threshold is met
await multisig.executeProposal(proposal.id);

console.log('Transfer executed!');
```

### Prover endpoint and retry policy

Both multisig SDKs retry only remote transaction proving. The default is two
total proof attempts. In TypeScript, endpoint-less injected provers, including
local and callback provers, run once. A custom remote URL overrides the Miden
client's injected prover.

```typescript
const client = new MultisigClient(midenClient, {
  guardianEndpoint: 'http://localhost:3000',
  midenRpcEndpoint: 'https://rpc.devnet.miden.io',
  prover: {
    url: 'https://prover.example',
    retry: { maxAttempts: 4 },
  },
});
```

```rust
use miden_multisig_client::{ProverConfig, ProverRetryPolicy};

let prover = ProverConfig::new()
    .with_url("https://prover.example")?
    .with_retry_policy(ProverRetryPolicy::new(4));

let client = MultisigClient::builder()
    .miden_endpoint(Endpoint::devnet())
    .guardian_endpoint("http://localhost:50051")
    .account_dir("/tmp/multisig-client")
    .prover_config(prover)
    .generate_key()
    .build()
    .await?;
```

URLs are validated during construction and must be absolute HTTP(S) URLs. A
custom prover never falls back to a default endpoint. Retries cover transient
proving conditions such as cancellation, deadlines, temporary unavailability,
capacity exhaustion, HTTP 408/429/502/503/504, I/O timeout, connection reset,
and broken pipe. Permanent or unrecognized failures return immediately.

Only proving is retried by this policy: transaction execution, GUARDIAN
coordination, Miden submission, and local application each run once. A larger
attempt budget can recover from brief failures but does not add prover
capacity. Idempotent Miden node reads have their own opt-in retry policy — see
the next section.

### Miden RPC retry policy

Both multisig SDKs retry idempotent Miden node reads under an `rpc` policy
that mirrors the prover configuration. The default is two total attempts —
one classified, jittered retry — matching the prover policy's default; an
explicit `maxAttempts` of 1 opts out. Transaction submission is **never
retried**, under any configuration: a submission whose outcome is unknown
could execute twice if re-sent.

Coverage differs by language. In Rust, the policy wraps the node client
itself, so every node read the SDK or the underlying Miden client issues —
syncs, account, note, and block lookups — retries under it. The same policy
also covers the private-note transport: note fetches and stream
establishment retry, while **note sends are never retried in-call** (the
client's relay outbox re-sends undelivered notes on later syncs, so an
in-call resend could deliver twice). Configuring the transport endpoint
itself is covered in [Note transport endpoint](#note-transport-endpoint).
Connection failures retry only when the cause is transport-shaped; TLS,
certificate, and invalid-endpoint problems fail immediately. In TypeScript,
the policy wraps the reads the SDK issues directly: on-chain account lookups,
state-commitment verification, and the guardian-switch node sync; syncs you
perform on the injected Miden client are owned by your application. As part
of this policy the Rust SDK also disables the Miden client library's internal
transport-retry loop, which silently retransmitted rate-limited requests —
**including submissions** — up to four extra times. This explicit policy is
the only retry layer: reads get one retry by default, submissions never.

```typescript
const client = new MultisigClient(midenClient, {
  guardianEndpoint: 'http://localhost:3000',
  midenRpcEndpoint: 'https://rpc.devnet.miden.io',
  prover: { retry: { maxAttempts: 4 } },
  rpc: { retry: { maxAttempts: 3 } },
});
```

```rust
use miden_multisig_client::{RpcConfig, RpcRetryPolicy};

let rpc = RpcConfig::new()
    .with_timeout_ms(15_000)?
    .with_retry_policy(RpcRetryPolicy::new(3));

let client = MultisigClient::builder()
    .miden_endpoint(Endpoint::devnet())
    .guardian_endpoint("http://localhost:50051")
    .account_dir("/tmp/multisig-client")
    .rpc_config(rpc)
    .generate_key()
    .build()
    .await?;
```

The classifier is shared with the prover policy (same transient/permanent
partition and backoff), extended with the node's transport renderings: a
rate-limit rejection (`Too Many Requests!`), and connection failures the node
reports under an `Unknown` status (`i/o timeout`, `connection error`,
`transport error`). Permanent failures — invalid arguments, not-found,
authentication — return immediately without consuming the budget, and once
the budget is exhausted the final upstream error is returned unchanged. A
larger budget adds patience against a rate-limited or briefly unreachable
node; it does not add node capacity.

In Rust, the per-request gRPC deadline defaults to 10 seconds on every SDK
node connection (presets, custom endpoints, and the direct commitment
reads); `with_timeout_ms` replaces it uniformly.
The TypeScript configuration intentionally has **no timeout**: the browser
WASM RPC client cannot cancel an in-flight request, and a JavaScript-side
timeout would abandon the call — whose side effects may still land — while
reporting failure. Retry behavior itself is fixture-verified to be identical
across both SDKs.

The Guardian server exposes the same policy for its own node reads via
`GUARDIAN_MIDEN_RPC_ENDPOINT`, `GUARDIAN_MIDEN_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS`, and
`GUARDIAN_MIDEN_RPC_MAX_ATTEMPTS` — see
[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md).

### Note transport endpoint

Private notes are relayed through a note transport service that is separate
from the node RPC. On the testnet and devnet presets both SDKs derive the
transport endpoint automatically; a custom node endpoint has no derivable
transport service, so it must be set explicitly — otherwise private-note
relay is disabled.

In Rust the endpoint lives on the builder, next to the node endpoint:

```rust
let client = MultisigClient::builder()
    .miden_endpoint(Endpoint::try_from("https://my-node.internal:57291")?)
    .note_transport_endpoint("https://my-transport.internal")
    .guardian_endpoint("http://localhost:50051")
    .account_dir("/tmp/multisig-client")
    .generate_key()
    .build()
    .await?;
```

In TypeScript the injected Miden client owns note relay, so the endpoint is
set when constructing it, not on the `MultisigClient` configuration:

```typescript
import { MidenClient } from '@miden-sdk/miden-sdk';
import { MultisigClient } from '@openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client';

const midenClient = await MidenClient.create({
  rpcUrl: 'https://my-node.internal:57291',
  noteTransportUrl: 'https://my-transport.internal',
});

const client = new MultisigClient(midenClient, {
  guardianEndpoint: 'http://localhost:3000',
  midenRpcEndpoint: 'https://my-node.internal:57291',
});
```

`noteTransportUrl` also accepts the `'testnet'` and `'devnet'` shorthands, so
a custom node on a public network can reuse that network's public transport
service. In both SDKs the transport shares the node RPC resilience policy
described above.

#### Rust

```rust
use miden_multisig_client::{MultisigClient, TransactionType, Endpoint};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // 1. Setup client
    let mut client = MultisigClient::builder()
        // the Miden node RPC endpoint
        .miden_endpoint(Endpoint::new("http://localhost:57291"))
        // the GUARDIAN server endpoint
        .guardian_endpoint("http://localhost:50051")
        // the directory where the miden-client will store the account data
        .account_dir("/tmp/multisig-client") 
        // generate a new Falcon keypair for GUARDIAN authentication
        .generate_key()
        .build()
        .await?;

    // 2. Create 1-of-3 multisig account
    let signer_commitments = vec![
        client.user_commitment(),
        cosigner1_commitment,
        cosigner2_commitment,
    ];
    let account = client.create_account(1, signer_commitments).await?;
    client.push_account().await?;

    println!("Account created: {}", account.id());

    // 3. Create a transfer proposal
    let tx = TransactionType::transfer(recipient_id, faucet_id, 1000);
    let proposal = client.propose_transaction(tx).await?;

    println!("Proposal created: {}", proposal.id);

    // 4. Cosigners sign (only one cosigner is needed)
    client.sign_proposal(&proposal.id).await?;

    // 5. Execute when threshold is met
    client.execute_proposal(&proposal.id).await?;

    println!("Transfer executed!");
    Ok(())
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Multisig Accounts

A multisig account requires **M-of-N** signatures to authorize transactions:
- **Threshold (M)**: Minimum signatures required
- **Signers (N)**: Total number of authorized cosigners
- **Commitment**: Each signer's Falcon public key commitment (32 bytes, 64 hex chars)

### Guardian

GUARDIAN is a coordination server that:
- Stores the account state off-chain
- Coordinates proposal signing between cosigners
- Provides acknowledgment signatures for on-chain execution (ensures the new state is available for the rest of the cosigners)
- Keeps multisig metadata private

> **Note**: GUARDIAN server setup is covered in separate documentation. This SDK assumes a running GUARDIAN instance.

### Proposal Lifecycle

```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌───────────┐
│ PENDING  │ ──► │  READY   │ ──► │ FINALIZED │
└──────────┘     └──────────┘     └───────────┘
     │                │                 │
 Collecting      Threshold           Executed
 signatures        met              on-chain
```

**States:**
- **Pending**: Proposal created, collecting signatures (shows X/Y signed)
- **Ready**: Threshold met, can be executed
- **Finalized**: Executed on-chain or discarded

#### Chain-anchored execution

Since Miden protocol 0.16 a signed transaction summary binds the reference
block commitment, so a summary produced at one block cannot be reproduced by
re-executing at a later one. Proposals therefore carry a **chain anchor**
(`chain_anchor` in the proposal metadata): a serialized Miden `ChainAnchor`
capturing the reference block the proposer executed at. Cosigners verify and
the executor executes against that anchor, so everyone reproduces the exact
summary the signatures authorize regardless of their own sync height. The
anchor is validated on receipt — its internal consistency at deserialization,
and its block commitment against the one signed into the summary — before
anything executes against it. A proposal without an anchor cannot be verified
or executed.

### Custom Proposal Types

Guardian accepts any non-empty `proposal_type`, not just the first-party
operations (issue #266). A proposal whose type the SDK does not model is
exposed as the **custom** bucket — `TransactionType::Custom` in Rust,
`proposalType: 'custom'` in TypeScript — while the label is preserved
(Rust `ProposalMetadata.proposal_type`, TypeScript `CustomProposalMetadata.rawProposalType`)
so it can be displayed. The SDK normalizes the label to lowercase `snake_case`
(trim + lowercase, then require `[a-z0-9_]+` — the same shape as built-in
labels), so `b2agg` is accepted, `B2Agg` is lowercased to `b2agg`, and
`add signer` / `add-signer` are rejected. (Normalization is SDK-side; the server
itself still accepts any non-empty string.)

Custom proposals can be listed, displayed, signed, and exported/imported.

**Producer API (issue #266).** The integration that owns a custom type builds
its own transaction and drives the create + execute ends; the SDK never
executes a transaction it does not understand. The model is **symmetric across
Rust and TypeScript**:

- **Create** — `propose_custom_transaction(transaction_request_bytes, proposal_type)` (Rust) /
  `createCustomProposal(transactionRequestBytes, proposalType)` (TS). The bytes are a
  serialized transaction request; the SDK derives the summary and pushes the
  proposal with the custom label. They are **not** stored on the server.
  Cosigners then review and sign through the normal flow.

  On a chain whose `verification_base_fee` is non-zero, the request must declare
  its fee conversion salt. Call `fee_conversion_salt(salt)` in Rust or
  `withFeeConversionSalt(salt)` in TypeScript. The Miden client derives the native
  1:1 conversion info from the execution reference header and commits it to the
  auth argument. The typed proposal builders do this for you. A custom producer
  must retain the original salt and use it again when rebuilding the request.
  Do not pass `summaryAuthArg(summary)` to `withFeeConversionSalt`: the summary
  contains the derived commitment, not the original salt.
- **Execute** — `prepare_custom_execution(proposal_id, transaction_request_bytes)` (Rust) /
  `prepareCustomExecution(proposalId, transactionRequestBytes)` (TS). The SDK verifies the
  proposal is ready, binding-checks the request against the signed commitment
  (before any acknowledgment request), fetches the GUARDIAN ack, and returns the
  **advice** (cosigner signatures + ack). The integration injects that advice
  into its own transaction and submits via its own client:

  ```ts
  // TypeScript: rebuild via the integration's builder (the wasm request is immutable)
  const advice = await multisig.prepareCustomExecution(proposalId, transactionRequestBytes);
  const finalReq = myBuilder.extendAdviceMap(advice).build();
  await multisig.submitTransaction(proposalId, finalReq);
  ```
  ```rust
  // Rust: inject into the request's advice map, submit via the SDK helper
  let advice = client.prepare_custom_execution(&proposal_id, &transaction_request_bytes).await?;
  let mut req = deserialize_transaction_request(&transaction_request_bytes)?;
  req.advice_map_mut().extend(advice);
  client.submit_transaction(&proposal_id, req).await?;
  ```

The SDK owns the security-critical pieces (binding check, signature + ack
assembly, ack-after-binding ordering); the integration owns only the
transaction recipe + submit. `execute_proposal` on a custom type returns a
clear error pointing to `prepare_custom_execution`. Because the integration must
rebuild its transaction to execute, **custom execution is performed by a party
that holds the recipe** (typically the producer), not by an arbitrary cosigner.

The returned advice is keyed by the signer and GUARDIAN commitments
(domain-separated digests over the signed `tx_summary`), the same keys the
SDK's own built-in execution uses. Extending a transaction's advice map with it
therefore does not collide with the transaction's ordinary inputs; the
integration extends rather than replaces its advice map.

> **Security:** for first-party types the SDK reconstructs the transaction from
> metadata and checks it against the signed `tx_summary` commitment. For custom
> types there is no such reconstruction, so the SDK cannot verify that display
> metadata (e.g. `description`) matches what the transaction actually does.
> Cosigners must verify the raw `tx_summary` they are signing — not trust the
> label or description.

### Offline Workflow

For air-gapped or offline signing scenarios:

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐

└──────┬──────┘         └──────┬──────┘         └──────┬──────┘
       │                       │                       │
       │  Export proposal.json │                       │
       │──────────────────────►│                       │

## TypeScript SDK Guide

### Installation & Setup

```typescript
import { MidenClient, AuthSecretKey } from '@miden-sdk/miden-sdk';
import {
  MultisigClient,
  Multisig,
  FalconSigner,
  AccountInspector,
  type MultisigConfig,
} from '@openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client';

// Initialize Miden client (connects to Miden node)
const midenClient = await MidenClient.createDevnet();

// Create signer from secret key
const secretKey = AuthSecretKey.rpoFalconWithRNG(undefined);
const signer = new FalconSigner(secretKey);

// Initialize multisig client
const client = new MultisigClient(midenClient, {
  guardianEndpoint: 'http://localhost:3000',
  midenRpcEndpoint: 'https://rpc.devnet.miden.io',
});
```

### Creating Accounts

```typescript
// Get GUARDIAN server's public key commitment
const guardianCommitment = await client.guardianClient.getPubkey();

// Define multisig configuration
const config: MultisigConfig = {
  threshold: 2,                              // 2 signatures required
  signerCommitments: [                       // 3 authorized signers
    signer.commitment,                       // Your commitment
    '0x1234...abcd',                        // Cosigner 1
    '0x5678...efgh',                        // Cosigner 2
  ],
  guardianCommitment,                            // GUARDIAN server commitment
};

// Create the account
const multisig = await client.create(config, signer);

// Register with GUARDIAN (stores initial state)
await multisig.registerOnGuardian();

console.log('Account ID:', multisig.accountId);
console.log('Threshold:', multisig.threshold);
console.log('Signers:', multisig.signerCommitments);
```

### Loading Existing Accounts

```typescript
// Load as a cosigner joining an existing multisig
const multisig = await client.load(accountId, signer);

// Fetch latest state from GUARDIAN
const state = await multisig.fetchState();

// Inspect account configuration
const detected = AccountInspector.fromBase64(state.stateDataBase64);
console.log('Threshold:', detected.threshold);
console.log('Signers:', detected.signerCommitments);
console.log('Vault balances:', detected.vaultBalances);
```

### Delta History

Guardian retains the account's canonical delta history, allowing a wallet to
render its history after recovery. `deltaHistory()` returns one
page at a time, newest-first by nonce, with server-decoded input and output
note summaries: note ID, P2ID/P2IDE/swap/mint/burn classification, note
visibility (`noteType`), assets, and sender or recipient when exposed by the
note script. Every entry carries `status: 'canonical'` today; the set widens
if the feed gains a status filter.

```typescript
let cursor: string | undefined;
do {
  const page = await multisig.deltaHistory({ limit: 50, cursor });
  for (const entry of page.entries) {
    console.log(`nonce ${entry.nonce} at ${entry.timestamp}`);
    for (const note of entry.outputNotes) {
      console.log(`  sent ${note.tag} note ${note.noteId}`);
    }
    if (entry.decodeWarnings.length > 0) {
      // Payload predates the current summary format; sections are empty.
    }
  }
  cursor = page.nextCursor;
} while (cursor !== undefined);
```

`limit` accepts 1–500 (default 50). Only canonical (confirmed)
transactions appear — pending proposals live on `syncProposals()`. The
feed is served even while the account is paused. Guardian only ever
sees transactions pushed through it, so history of transactions the
account executed elsewhere is not included. Output notes whose full
details are not in the stored summary (e.g. private notes carried as
partial notes) appear with `tag: 'custom'` and no recipient.

### Recovering Notes After Device Loss

Normal forward sync cannot see notes that landed behind the store's
cursors. After `load()` on a recovered account, `multisig.recoverNotes()`
runs the three recovery strategies as one flow — the private-note transport
drain, the proposal-embedded note import, and the historical public-note
backfill — and finishes with a normal sync (transport fetch, chain sync,
and GUARDIAN state sync) so imported notes are verified and ready to
consume. The flow is the one public entry point: the strategies are
internal, so a caller cannot accidentally skip the context they need (a
tracked account, a synced store) or the final verifying sync.

```typescript
const multisig = await client.load(accountId, signer);

const report = await multisig.recoverNotes();
console.log(`recovered ${report.imported} notes`);
for (const problem of report.problems) {
  // A strategy that could not run at all lands here; the flow continues
  // with the remaining strategies either way.
  console.warn(`step ${problem.step} did not run: ${problem.reason}`);
}
if (report.retryable) {
  // The flow is idempotent — rerun it to plausibly recover more.
}
```

Strategies are individually selectable and the backfill's block range can be
bounded:

```typescript
// Rescan only the transport backlog and recent public history, skipping the
// proposal import and the final verifying sync.
const report = await multisig.recoverNotes({
  proposalImport: false,
  fromBlock: 1_690_000,
  syncAfter: false,
});
```

The combined `NoteRecoveryReport` carries each strategy's own report
(`transport`, `proposalImport`, `backfill`) untouched, plus the `problems`
list, `synced`, the total `imported` count, and an aggregate `retryable`
flag.

#### The transport-drain strategy

A fresh store has no note-transport cursor — and in a store shared with
other accounts, sync may have advanced the cursor past private notes
addressed to the recovered account. The drain rescans the full transport
backlog for every tracked note tag (running as many transport syncs as the
upstream per-sync tag backfill cap requires), regardless of the stored
cursor, and never regresses it. It is idempotent, and a failed drain
restores the covered-tags bookkeeping so normal sync keeps working exactly
as before the attempt.

Transport problems land in `report.transport`, never as exceptions:
`unavailable` means no transport endpoint is configured or the transport
could not be reached before anything was imported; `failed` with
`retryable: true` keeps any partial progress and rerunning continues it.

**Not a backup:** transport recovery is bounded by the transport service's
retention. Senders may deliver private notes out-of-band without using the
transport, and relayed blobs are pruned after the retention window. Notes
outside both are recoverable only from their sender (see the note
export/import helpers).

#### The proposal-import strategy

v2 `consume_notes` proposals embed the serialized notes they consume, so
pending proposals are opportunistic recovery material: the strategy syncs
them from GUARDIAN (isolating per-proposal parse or binding failures as
`invalid` outcomes instead of failing the whole step), validates each
embedded note against the proposal's declared note ids, fetches on-chain
inclusion proofs, and imports per note — so it works for private notes too;
the node never needs to hold the note body.

Each unique embedded note gets a `NoteImportOutcome` in
`report.proposalImport` (`imported`, `already-present`, `already-consumed`,
`not-committed`, `invalid`, or `failed`); duplicates across proposals fold
into one outcome and no per-note problem blocks the others. A note not yet
on chain is recorded as expected with its sync-hint tag so a later sync
picks it up, and an import whose inclusion proof fails verification against
the authenticated chain is demoted to `failed` rather than counted as
recovered.

Proposals are opportunistic recovery material, not a backup: v1 proposals
carry no note bytes, proposals disappear once canonicalized, and embedded
note bytes are visible to the GUARDIAN operator (existing v2 behavior, not
a new exposure).

#### The public-backfill strategy

Normal forward sync starts from the store's **global** cursor, so in a
shared store the cursor may already be past blocks containing the recovered
account's notes. The backfill scans a historical block range — genesis to
the current chain tip by default — for public notes addressed at the
account's standard note tag and imports them with their on-chain inclusion
proofs, without ever touching the global sync height. The scan's cost grows
with the number of matching notes, not the range length, so a full
genesis-to-tip scan is fast on an ordinary account. The flow syncs the
chain state before this strategy runs, so it works on a store that has
never synced.

`report.backfill` carries the requested range (`scannedFrom` /
`scannedTo`), the number of unique tag matches (`discovered`), the private
matches skipped (`skippedPrivate` — the chain holds no body for them; the
other two strategies cover those), the matches the relevance screen
rejected (`skippedIrrelevant`), the matches this SDK's static screen could
not judge (`skippedUnscreenable` — custom note scripts; the Rust SDK's
execution-based screener judges every note and always reports `0` there),
and one `NoteImportOutcome` per screened-in public note. A proof-less
expected record left by an earlier proposal import is upgraded in place
with the freshly fetched proof rather than skipped. Sub-ranges the scan
could not cover land in `uncovered` with `retryable`/`reason` set, so a
partial scan never aborts the rest of the flow.

### Preserving Notes Across a Guardian Switch

Pending proposals do not survive a guardian switch: the new GUARDIAN is
registered with bare account state, so once the client repoints, the notes
embedded in the old GUARDIAN's pending consume-notes proposals are the one
recovery source `recoverNotes` can no longer reach. `executeProposal` runs
the proposal-import slice of the flow automatically on the switch-guardian
path — against the old GUARDIAN, before the switch transaction executes —
so those notes land in the local store while they are still reachable
(issue #417). The step is best-effort and bounded by a 30s timeout with
cooperative cancellation: an unreachable or hung old GUARDIAN is warned
about, never allowed to block the switch.

The transport drain and public backfill deliberately do not run on the
switch path: a switch executes against an intact local store, and both the
note transport and the node are configured independently of the GUARDIAN,
so a switch loses nothing they rescan. They remain device-loss recovery
tools and work unchanged against the new GUARDIAN.

A wallet repointing a follower client by hand should request the same
preservation before switching clients:

```typescript
// Before setGuardianClient(newGuardian):
const report = await multisig.preservePreSwitchProposalNotes();
```

`preservePreSwitchProposalNotes` is the one public entry point for switch
preservation — it wraps the import slice in the switch-specific safety
contract, so there is no equivalent way to request it through
`recoverNotes` options. It returns the slice's `NoteRecoveryReport` (or
`undefined` when the flow could not run or timed out) and never throws.
On timeout a cancellation token stops every step and inner loop at its
next checkpoint (including between RPC retry attempts), and the switch
waits a short bounded grace for the one uninterruptible in-flight
operation to settle so it cannot overlap the switch transaction. Imported
notes are verified by the next normal sync. Like every listing-based flow
this covers proposals pending at the next nonce; one superseded at an
earlier nonce (it lost a same-nonce race) is filtered out and its embedded
notes are not imported here.

### Proposal Operations

Every `create*Proposal` method takes a single trailing options object (issue
#387). All of them accept an optional `nonce` that identifies the proposal
(defaults to `Date.now()`); method-specific options are listed with each
method below. Passing a legacy positional `nonce` number where the options
object is expected throws instead of silently applying defaults.

#### P2ID Transfer (Send Funds)

```typescript
const proposal = await multisig.createP2idProposal(
  recipientAccountId,    // Recipient's account ID
  faucetAccountId,       // Faucet (token) ID
  1000n                  // Amount to send
);

// Private note: only the note's hash is published on chain. Pass `noteType`
// in the options object (`NoteType` comes from `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk`).
import { NoteType } from '@miden-sdk/miden-sdk';

const privateProposal = await multisig.createP2idProposal(
  recipientAccountId,
  faucetAccountId,
  1000n,
  { noteType: NoteType.Private },  // note visibility; defaults to NoteType.Public
);

// P2IDE note (issue #366): pass `reclaimHeight` and/or `timelockHeight`
// (absolute block heights) to create a reclaimable/timelocked note instead
// of a plain P2ID note. `reclaimHeight` lets the sender reclaim the note if
// it is still unconsumed at that block; `timelockHeight` prevents
// consumption before that block.
const reclaimableProposal = await multisig.createP2idProposal(
  recipientAccountId,
  faucetAccountId,
  1000n,
  { reclaimHeight: 500_000 },
);
```

Note that the two heights are independent and the SDK does not cross-check
them: a `timelockHeight` at or above `reclaimHeight` means the recipient
never has a window in which they can claim before the sender can reclaim —
usually not what you want.

> **Warning:** a `private` P2ID note publishes only its hash on chain. The
> recipient cannot discover the note by syncing; the full note details must
> be shared with them out-of-band before they can consume it. Use
> `exportNoteToBytes` / `importNoteFromBytes` (or the browser file variants
> `exportNoteToFile` / `importNoteFromFile`) for that transfer (issue #356):

```typescript
// Sender: resolve the note ID BEFORE executing (it derives from the
// pre-execution vault state), then export after execution.
const noteId = await multisig.getP2idNoteId(privateProposal);
// ...sign + execute the proposal...
const noteFileBytes = await multisig.exportNoteToBytes(noteId);
// Deliver `noteFileBytes` to the recipient out-of-band (file, message, ...).
// Or, in a browser, trigger a download of the note file directly:
await multisig.exportNoteToFile(noteId);

// Recipient: import the bytes (or a File from an <input type="file">), then
// sync so the note's on-chain commitment is tracked; it then appears in
// getConsumableNotes() and can be consumed with createConsumeNotesProposal
// as usual.
const importedNoteId = await multisig.importNoteFromBytes(noteFileBytes);
```

> **Note:** every cosigner device that verifies or signs the consume-notes

> authenticated from unauthenticated consumption) and rejects the proposal
> with `metadata does not match tx_summary`. The sender's own device heals
> itself: it already knows the full note, so a post-commit sync is enough.

#### Consume Notes (Claim Received Funds)

```typescript
// Get consumable notes
const notes = await multisig.getConsumableNotes();

// Create proposal to consume them
const noteIds = notes.map(n => n.id);
const proposal = await multisig.createConsumeNotesProposal(noteIds);
```

A private note received out-of-band must first be loaded with
`importNoteFromBytes(noteFileBytes)` or `importNoteFromFile(file)` (see the
P2ID section above); after a sync it shows up in `getConsumableNotes()` like
any public note.

#### Add Signer

```typescript
const proposal = await multisig.createAddSignerProposal(
  newSignerCommitment,     // New signer's public key commitment
  { newThreshold },        // Options: nonce, newThreshold (defaults to current)
);
```

> **Override dilution on signer growth**: per-procedure threshold overrides
> are absolute signature counts, and the on-chain update never re-scales
> them — growing the signer set silently lowers every override's effective
> signing ratio (a 2-of-2 override becomes 2-of-n). Both SDKs surface this:
> the TypeScript SDK logs a `console.warn` per affected override and exposes
> `multisig.overridesDilutedBySignerGrowth(newNumSigners)`; the Rust SDK
> emits a `tracing::warn!` in `propose_transaction` and exposes
> `MultisigAccount::overrides_diluted_by_signer_growth(new_num_signers)`.
> To keep the intended security level, raise the affected overrides via an
> update-procedure-threshold proposal alongside the growth.

> **Overrides apply to guardian rotation too**: `update_guardian` is a valid
> override target in both SDKs. Guardian rotation is a note-less operation, so
> the upstream contract skips the guardian signature check when
> `update_guardian_public_key` is the only non-auth procedure called — the
> multisig quorum alone authorizes it. That quorum is the override on
> `update_guardian`'s root when one is set, so an override of 1 lets a single
> signer replace the guardian with no guardian consent. Nothing in the builder
> or the contract restricts overrides on this root; treat an override on
> `update_guardian` as a deliberate reduction of the account's recovery
> threshold. Installing such an override is gated — at creation the account's
> author chooses it, and at runtime `set_procedure_threshold` requires the
> default quorum plus a guardian signature — but the gate applies only to
> installing it. Once stored, the reduced quorum governs every future rotation
> on its own, with no further guardian involvement, until another
> update-procedure-threshold proposal raises it back.

#### Remove Signer

```typescript
const proposal = await multisig.createRemoveSignerProposal(
  signerToRemove,          // Signer's commitment to remove
  { newThreshold },        // Options: nonce, newThreshold (defaults to
                           // min(current threshold, remaining signer count))
);
```

#### Change Threshold

```typescript
const proposal = await multisig.createChangeThresholdProposal(
  newThreshold           // New threshold value
);
```

#### Switch GUARDIAN Provider

```typescript
const proposal = await multisig.createSwitchGuardianProposal(
  newGuardianEndpoint,        // New GUARDIAN server URL
  newGuardianCommitment       // New GUARDIAN server's public key
);
```

When the current GUARDIAN is unreachable, create the switch proposal fully
offline instead — nothing is pushed to the current operator (issue #433;
mirrors the Rust `create_proposal_offline`). The returned `ExportedProposal`
already carries the proposer's signature; share its JSON with cosigners for
`importProposal` / `signProposalOffline`, then execute:

```typescript
const exported = await multisig.createSwitchGuardianProposalOffline(
  newGuardianEndpoint,
  newGuardianCommitment
);
```

### Signing & Executing Proposals

```typescript
// List all pending proposals
const proposals = await multisig.syncProposals();

for (const proposal of proposals) {
  console.log(`${proposal.id}: ${proposal.status.type}`);

  if (proposal.status.type === 'pending') {
    console.log(`  Signatures: ${proposal.status.signaturesCollected}/${proposal.status.signaturesRequired}`);
  }
}

// Sign a proposal
const signed = await multisig.signProposal(proposalId);

// Execute when ready
if (signed.status.type === 'ready') {
  await multisig.executeProposal(proposalId);
}
```

### Offline Export/Import

```typescript
// Export proposal for offline signing
const json = multisig.exportProposalToJson(proposalId);
// Share via file, QR code, etc.

// On air-gapped machine: import and sign
const imported = multisig.importProposal(json);
const signedJson = multisig.signProposalOffline(proposalId);

// Back on online machine: import signed proposal
const signedProposal = multisig.importProposal(signedJson);
await multisig.executeProposal(signedProposal.id);
```

### Recovering Accounts By Key

Use `recoverByKey` when a wallet has a signing key from an account's
authorization set but does not know the account ID yet. The helper queries
Guardian's `/state/lookup` endpoint with proof-of-possession of the key,
fetches state for each matching account, and returns `(accountId, state)`
pairs.

```typescript
const recovered = await client.recoverByKey(signer);

if (recovered.length === 0) {
  console.log('No account on this Guardian authorizes this key');
}

for (const { accountId, state } of recovered) {
  console.log('Recovered account:', accountId);
  console.log('State commitment:', state.commitment);

  const multisig = await client.load(accountId, signer);
  // Continue with normal proposal or sync flows.
}
```

The signer passed to `recoverByKey` must implement `signLookupMessage`. The
bundled `FalconSigner`, `EcdsaSigner`, Miden Wallet signer, and Para signer
support it. Multiple matches are valid: the same key commitment may authorize
more than one account, and the method returns all matches instead of choosing
one implicitly.

## Rust SDK Guide

### Installation & Setup

```rust
use miden_multisig_client::{
    MultisigClient, MultisigClientBuilder,
    MultisigAccount, TransactionType,
    Proposal, ProposalStatus,
    KeyManager, GuardianKeyStore,
    Endpoint, Word, AccountId, SecretKey,
};

// Build client with fluent API
let mut client = MultisigClient::builder()
    .miden_endpoint(Endpoint::new("http://localhost:57291"))
    .guardian_endpoint("http://localhost:50051")
    .account_dir("/tmp/multisig-data")
    .generate_key()  // Or: .with_secret_key(key)
    .build()
    .await?;
```

### Creating Accounts

```rust
// Collect signer commitments (your key + cosigners)
let signer_commitments = vec![
    client.user_commitment(),          // Your commitment
    commitment_from_hex("0x1234...")?, // Cosigner 1
    commitment_from_hex("0x5678...")?, // Cosigner 2
];

// Create 2-of-3 multisig
let account = client.create_account(2, signer_commitments).await?;

// Register with GUARDIAN
client.push_account().await?;

println!("Created account: {}", account.id());
println!("Threshold: {}", account.threshold()?);
println!("Signers: {:?}", account.cosigner_commitments_hex());
```

### Loading Existing Accounts

```rust
// Pull account from GUARDIAN (as a cosigner)
let account = client.pull_account(account_id).await?;

// Sync with Miden network
client.sync().await?;

// Inspect account
println!("Threshold: {}", account.threshold()?);
println!("Nonce: {}", account.nonce());
println!("GUARDIAN commitment: {:?}", account.guardian_commitment()?);
```

### Delta History

Guardian retains the account's canonical delta history, allowing a wallet to
render its history after recovery. `delta_history()` returns one
`HistoryPage` at a time, newest-first by nonce, with server-decoded input and
output note summaries (typed tags, visibility, assets, counterparties). Every
entry carries `HistoryEntryStatus::Canonical` today; the set widens if the
feed gains a status filter.

```rust
let mut cursor: Option<String> = None;
loop {
    let page = client.delta_history(Some(50), cursor.take()).await?;
    for entry in &page.entries {
        println!("nonce {} at {}", entry.nonce, entry.timestamp);
        for note in &entry.output_notes {
            println!("  sent {} note {}", note.tag.as_str(), note.note_id);
        }
    }
    match page.next_cursor {
        Some(next) => cursor = Some(next),
        None => break,
    }
}
```

`limit` accepts 1–500 (server default 50 when `None`). Only canonical
(confirmed) transactions appear — pending proposals live on
`list_proposals()`. The feed is served even while the account is
paused. Guardian only ever sees transactions pushed through it, so
history of transactions the account executed elsewhere is not included.
Output notes whose full details are not in the stored summary (e.g.
private notes carried as partial notes) appear with tag `custom` and no
recipient.

### Recovering Notes After Device Loss

Normal forward sync cannot see notes that landed behind the store's
cursors. After `pull_account` on a recovered account, `recover_notes` runs
the three recovery strategies as one flow — the private-note transport
drain, the proposal-embedded note import, and the historical public-note
backfill — and finishes with a normal sync so imported notes are verified
and ready to consume. The flow is the one public entry point: the
strategies are internal, so a caller cannot accidentally skip the context
they need (a tracked account, a synced store) or the final verifying sync.

```rust
client.pull_account(account_id).await?;

// `None` runs every strategy over the full chain and syncs afterwards.
let report = client.recover_notes(None).await?;
println!("recovered {} notes", report.imported);
for problem in &report.problems {
    // A strategy that could not run at all lands here; the flow continues
    // with the remaining strategies either way.
    eprintln!("step {} did not run: {}", problem.step, problem.reason);
}
if report.retryable {
    // The flow is idempotent — rerun it to plausibly recover more.
}
```

Strategies are individually selectable and the backfill's block range can be
bounded:

```rust
use miden_multisig_client::{NoteRecoveryOptions, PublicBackfillOptions};

// Rescan only the transport backlog and recent public history, skipping the
// proposal import and the final verifying sync.
let report = client
    .recover_notes(Some(NoteRecoveryOptions {
        proposal_import: false,
        backfill: PublicBackfillOptions {
            from_block: Some(1_690_000u32.into()),
            ..Default::default()
        },
        sync_after: false,
        ..Default::default()
    }))
    .await?;
```

The combined `NoteRecoveryReport` carries each strategy's own report
(`transport`, `proposal_import`, `backfill`) untouched, plus the `problems`
list, `synced`, the total `imported` count, and an aggregate `retryable`
flag.

#### The transport-drain strategy

A fresh store has no note-transport cursor — and in a store shared with
other accounts, sync may have advanced the cursor past private notes
addressed to the recovered account. The drain rescans the full transport
backlog for every tracked note tag (running as many transport syncs as the
upstream per-sync tag backfill cap requires), regardless of the stored
cursor, and never regresses it. It is idempotent, and a failed drain
restores the covered-tags bookkeeping so normal sync keeps working exactly
as before the attempt.

Transport problems land in `report.transport`, never as errors:
`Unavailable` means no transport endpoint is configured or the transport
could not be reached before anything was imported; `Failed` with
`retryable: true` keeps any partial progress and rerunning continues it.

**Not a backup:** transport recovery is bounded by the transport service's
retention. Senders may deliver private notes out-of-band without using the
transport, and relayed blobs are pruned after the retention window. Notes
outside both are recoverable only from their sender (see
`import_note_from_file`).

#### The proposal-import strategy

v2 `consume_notes` proposals embed the serialized notes they consume, so
pending proposals are opportunistic recovery material: the strategy lists
them from GUARDIAN (isolating per-proposal parse or binding failures as
`Invalid` outcomes instead of failing the whole step), validates each
embedded note against the proposal's declared note ids, fetches on-chain
inclusion proofs, and imports per note — so it works for private notes too;
the node never needs to hold the note body.

Each unique embedded note gets a `NoteImportOutcome` in
`report.proposal_import` (`Imported`, `AlreadyPresent`, `AlreadyConsumed`,
`NotCommitted`, `Invalid`, or `Failed`); duplicates across proposals fold
into one outcome and no per-note problem blocks the others. A note not yet
on chain is recorded in `Expected` state with its sync-hint tag so a later
sync picks it up, and an import whose inclusion proof fails verification
against the authenticated chain is demoted to `Failed` rather than counted
as recovered.

Proposals are opportunistic recovery material, not a backup: v1 proposals
carry no note bytes, proposals disappear once canonicalized, and the
embedded bytes are visible to the GUARDIAN operator (existing v2 behavior,
not a new exposure).

#### The public-backfill strategy

Normal forward sync starts from the store's **global** cursor, so in a
shared store the cursor may already be past blocks containing the recovered
account's notes. The backfill scans a historical block range — genesis to
the current chain tip by default — for public notes addressed at the
account's standard note tag and imports them with their on-chain inclusion
proofs, without ever touching the global sync height. The scan's cost grows
with the number of matching notes, not the range length, so a full
genesis-to-tip scan is fast on an ordinary account. The flow syncs the
chain state before this strategy runs, so it works on a store that has
never synced.

`report.backfill` carries the requested range (`scanned_from` /
`scanned_to`), the number of unique tag matches (`discovered`), the private
matches skipped (`skipped_private` — the chain holds no body for them; the
other two strategies cover those), the matches the execution-based
`NoteScreener` rejected (`skipped_irrelevant` — tags are best-effort,
truncated filters, and exactly like normal sync only notes the account can
actually consume are imported), and one `NoteImportOutcome` per screened-in
public note (`skipped_unscreenable` exists for cross-SDK parity and is
always `0` here). A proof-less expected record left by an earlier proposal
import is upgraded in place with the freshly fetched proof rather than
skipped. Sub-ranges the scan could not cover land in `uncovered` with
`retryable`/`reason` set, so a partial scan never aborts the rest of the
flow.

### Preserving Notes Across a Guardian Switch

Pending proposals do not survive a guardian switch: the new GUARDIAN is
registered with bare account state, so once the client repoints, the notes
embedded in the old GUARDIAN's pending consume-notes proposals are the one
recovery source `recover_notes` can no longer reach. `execute_proposal`
runs the proposal-import slice of the flow automatically on the
switch-guardian path — against the old GUARDIAN, before the switch
transaction executes — so those notes land in the local store while they
are still reachable (issue #417). The step is best-effort and bounded by a
30s timeout: an unreachable or hung old GUARDIAN is warned about, never
allowed to block the switch.

The transport drain and public backfill deliberately do not run on the
switch path: a switch executes against an intact local store, and both the
note transport and the node are configured independently of the GUARDIAN,
so a switch loses nothing they rescan. They remain device-loss recovery
tools and work unchanged against the new GUARDIAN. The offline switch flow
(`execute_imported_proposal`) also skips the import — it exists to avoid
contacting the GUARDIAN at all — so when the old GUARDIAN is in fact still
reachable, run the preservation explicitly before executing offline.

A wallet repointing a follower client by hand should request the same
preservation before `set_guardian_endpoint`:

```rust
// Before set_guardian_endpoint(new_endpoint, true):
let report = client.preserve_pre_switch_proposal_notes().await;
```

`preserve_pre_switch_proposal_notes` is the one public entry point for
switch preservation — it wraps the import slice in the switch-specific
safety contract (timeout, cancellation, warnings), so there is no
equivalent way to request it through `recover_notes` options. It returns
the slice's `NoteRecoveryReport` (`None` when the flow could not run or
timed out) and never errors; on timeout the in-flight flow is cancelled
and the switch proceeds. Imported notes are verified by the next normal
sync. Like every listing-based flow this covers proposals pending at the
next nonce; one superseded at an earlier nonce (it lost a same-nonce
race) is filtered out and its embedded notes are not imported here.

### Transaction Types

```rust
// P2ID Transfer (public note)
let tx = TransactionType::transfer(recipient_id, faucet_id, 1000);

// P2ID Transfer with a private note (only the note hash is published on
// chain; the recipient needs the note shared out-of-band — see
// "Out-of-Band Note Transfer" below). `NoteType` is re-exported from
// `miden_protocol::note`.
let tx = TransactionType::transfer_with_note_type(
    recipient_id, faucet_id, 1000, NoteType::Private,
);

// P2IDE Transfer (issue #366): optional reclaim and/or timelock block

use std::num::NonZeroU32;
use miden_multisig_client::P2ideHeights;

let tx = TransactionType::transfer_p2ide(
    recipient_id, faucet_id, 1000, NoteType::Public,
    P2ideHeights { reclaim: NonZeroU32::new(500_000), timelock: None },

// Consume Notes
let tx = TransactionType::consume_notes(vec![note_id1, note_id2]);

let tx = TransactionType::update_signers(new_threshold, new_signer_list);

// Switch GUARDIAN Provider
let tx = TransactionType::switch_guardian(new_endpoint, new_commitment);
```

### Proposal Operations

```rust
// Create and submit proposal
let proposal = client.propose_transaction(tx).await?;
println!("Proposal ID: {}", proposal.id);

// Or with offline fallback
match client.propose_with_fallback(tx).await? {
    ProposalResult::Online(proposal) => {
        println!("Submitted to GUARDIAN: {}", proposal.id);
    }
    ProposalResult::Offline(exported) => {
        // Save for file-based sharing
        std::fs::write("proposal.json", exported.to_json()?)?;
    }
}
```

### Listing & Signing Proposals

```rust
// List pending proposals
let proposals = client.list_proposals().await?;

for proposal in &proposals {
    match &proposal.status {
        ProposalStatus::Pending => {
            let (signatures_collected, signatures_required) = proposal.signature_counts();
            println!("{}: {}/{} signatures",
                proposal.id, signatures_collected, signatures_required);
            println!("  Signed by: {:?}", proposal.metadata.signers);
        }
        ProposalStatus::Ready => {
            println!("{}: Ready to execute", proposal.id);
        }
        ProposalStatus::Finalized => {
            println!("{}: Already executed", proposal.id);
        }
    }
}

// Sign a proposal
client.sign_proposal(&proposal_id).await?;

// Execute when ready
client.execute_proposal(&proposal_id).await?;
```

### Offline Export/Import

```rust
// Create offline proposal (when GUARDIAN unavailable)
let exported = client.create_proposal_offline(tx).await?;
std::fs::write("proposal.json", exported.to_json()?)?;

// On air-gapped machine: load and sign
let json = std::fs::read_to_string("proposal.json")?;
let mut exported: ExportedProposal = serde_json::from_str(&json)?;
client.sign_imported_proposal(&mut exported)?;
std::fs::write("signed.json", exported.to_json()?)?;

// Back online: execute
let json = std::fs::read_to_string("signed.json")?;
let exported: ExportedProposal = serde_json::from_str(&json)?;
client.execute_imported_proposal(&exported).await?;
```

### Note Filtering

```rust
use miden_multisig_client::NoteFilter;

// List all consumable notes
let notes = client.list_consumable_notes().await?;

// Filter by faucet
let filter = NoteFilter::by_faucet(faucet_id);
let notes = client.list_consumable_notes_filtered(filter).await?;

// Filter by faucet with minimum amount
let filter = NoteFilter::by_faucet_min_amount(faucet_id, 5000);
let notes = client.list_consumable_notes_filtered(filter).await?;

for note in notes {
    println!("Note {}: {} tokens", note.id, note.amount_for_faucet(faucet_id));
}
```

### Out-of-Band Note Transfer (Private Notes)

A private P2ID note publishes only its commitment on chain, so the recipient's
client can never learn the note contents via sync. The sender must export the
note and deliver the file out-of-band (issue #356):

```rust
// Sender: resolve the note ID BEFORE executing (it derives from the
// pre-execution vault state), then export after execution.
let note_id = client.p2id_note_id(&proposal)?;
client.execute_proposal(&proposal.id).await?;
client.export_note_to_file(&note_id.to_hex(), Path::new("note.mno")).await?;
// Deliver note.mno to the recipient out-of-band (file, message, ...).

// Recipient: import the file, then sync so the note's on-chain commitment
// is tracked; it then appears in list_consumable_notes() and can be
// consumed with a regular consume-notes proposal.
let imported_note_id = client.import_note_from_file(Path::new("note.mno")).await?;
client.sync().await?;
```

`export_note_to_bytes` / `import_note_from_bytes` are the in-memory variants
for programmatic delivery.

Every cosigner device that verifies or signs the consume-notes proposal needs
the note in its local store with the on-chain inclusion proof — deliver the
note file to each of them (import + sync), not just to the proposer. A
cosigner whose store lacks the authenticated note rebuilds the transaction
differently (the input-notes commitment distinguishes authenticated from
unauthenticated consumption) and rejects the proposal with `metadata does not
match tx_summary`. The sender's own device heals itself: it already knows the
full note, so a post-commit sync is enough.

### Recovering Accounts By Key

Use `recover_by_key` when the configured signer is known but the account ID is
not. The client signs a lookup-bound authentication message, asks Guardian for
accounts that authorize the signer's commitment, fetches state for each match,
and returns `RecoveredAccount` values.

```rust
let recovered = client.recover_by_key().await?;

if recovered.is_empty() {
    println!("No account on this Guardian authorizes this key");
}

for entry in recovered {
    println!("Recovered account: {}", entry.account_id);
    println!("State commitment: {}", entry.state.commitment);

    let account_id = AccountId::from_hex(&entry.account_id)?;
    client.pull_account(account_id).await?;
    // Continue with normal proposal or sync flows.
}
```

An empty list means the key is valid but this Guardian has no account metadata
that authorizes its commitment. Authentication failures, malformed lookup
responses, and per-account `get_state` failures are returned as errors.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Treasury Management (2-of-3)

A company treasury requiring 2 of 3 executives to approve transfers.

```typescript
// Setup: CEO, CFO, and COO each have their own signer
const config = {
  threshold: 2,
  signerCommitments: [ceoCommitment, cfoCommitment, cooCommitment],
  guardianCommitment,
};

const treasury = await client.create(config, ceoSigner);
await treasury.registerOnGuardian();

// CEO proposes payment to vendor
const payment = await treasury.createP2idProposal(
  vendorAccountId,
  usdcFaucetId,
  50000n
);

// CFO reviews and signs
const cfoMultisig = await cfoClient.load(treasury.accountId, cfoSigner);
await cfoMultisig.syncProposals();
await cfoMultisig.signProposal(payment.id);

// Payment executes (threshold met: CEO + CFO = 2)
await treasury.executeProposal(payment.id);
```

### Use Case 2: Secure Operations (3-of-5)

High-security operations requiring 3 of 5 board members.

```rust
// Create 3-of-5 multisig
let board_commitments = vec![member1, member2, member3, member4, member5];
let account = client.create_account(3, board_commitments).await?;

// Propose removing a compromised member
let tx = TransactionType::remove_cosigner(compromised_member);
let proposal = client.propose_transaction(tx).await?;

// Three members must sign
// member1.sign_proposal(...)
// member2.sign_proposal(...)
// member3.sign_proposal(...)

// Execute with 3 signatures
client.execute_proposal(&proposal.id).await?;
```

### Use Case 3: Note Consumption

Claiming tokens sent to the multisig.

```typescript
// Check for incoming notes
const notes = await multisig.getConsumableNotes();

console.log('Pending notes:');
for (const note of notes) {
  for (const asset of note.assets) {
    if (asset.isFungible()) {
      console.log(`  ${note.id}: ${asset.amount()} from faucet ${asset.faucetId()}`);
    }
  }
}

// Create proposal to consume all notes
const noteIds = notes.map(n => n.id);
const proposal = await multisig.createConsumeNotesProposal(noteIds);

// After threshold signatures...
await multisig.executeProposal(proposal.id);

console.log('Notes consumed, funds now in vault');
```

## Version Compatibility

Which Miden protocol line each Guardian release targets, the exact `miden-client`
and `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` pins, what broke between lines, and which upgrades
reset stored data: see
[`MIDEN_COMPATIBILITY.md`](./MIDEN_COMPATIBILITY.md).

Guardian's version and Miden's are not aligned (Guardian 0.16.x runs on Miden
0.15; Miden 0.16 lands in Guardian 0.17.x), so read that matrix rather than
matching the numbers. Per-release breaking changes are also in the
[GitHub release notes](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/guardian/releases).

### Contract version pinning

Accounts are built from the audited upstream `AuthGuardedMultisig` component, pinned
exactly in both SDKs so a TypeScript-built account is byte-identical to a Rust-built
one:

- **Rust**: the `miden-standards` pin in the workspace `Cargo.toml`
- **TypeScript**: the `@miden-sdk/miden-sdk` pin, whose bundled WASM embeds the
  matching upstream `miden-standards` guarded-multisig component

Matching versions is what makes the roots match, because neither SDK compiles the auth
component any more: both ask `miden-standards` for its `AuthGuardedMultisig` and use what
it returns. That settles the linkage question that used to matter here. `auth_tx` calls
`miden::standards::fee`, so its root depends on whether the standards package is linked
statically (the callee's MAST is inlined) or dynamically (an external reference is left) —
compiling an equivalent source locally links dynamically and roots differently, which is
why a locally built component could not be classified by `AccountComponentInterface::from_procedures`
and never had fee conversion info attached. Taking the component from upstream removes the
choice, so the pinned roots describe upstream's build and nothing else.

The exact versions for each Guardian release are in
[`MIDEN_COMPATIBILITY.md`](./MIDEN_COMPATIBILITY.md#support-matrix); they are not
repeated here so there is one place to update.

The pins are deliberate and must move together: nothing at build time verifies the
npm SDK's embedded miden-standards matches the Rust pin — the CI parity gates
(`procedure_roots_match_upstream_component`, the vitest `procedure-roots` test, and
the Playwright determinism spec) are what catch drift.

**Deployed accounts are immutable.** An account's code — and therefore its procedure
roots — is fixed at creation. The SDK's hardcoded `PROCEDURE_ROOTS` /
`ProcedureName::root()` values, and the transaction scripts it compiles against the
bundled library, all assume the account was built from the *currently pinned*
contract version. Consequences of bumping the pin to a miden-standards release whose
MASM changed:

- Management transactions built by the new SDK **fail against old accounts** (the
  script calls a procedure root the old account's code does not export).
- Per-procedure threshold reads and `set_procedure_threshold` writes key the
  account's `procedure_thresholds` storage map by the *new* roots — against an old
  account they silently miss the stored overrides or store overrides the account
  never consults.

**Release policy until a contract-version registry lands**: treat any
miden-standards / @miden-sdk pin bump that changes procedure roots as a breaking
release. Bump the minor version, regenerate the root constants (both SDKs), and
state explicitly in the release notes that the new SDK operates only accounts
created with the new contract version. The planned fix is a version registry keyed
by the account's auth-procedure root, letting one SDK operate accounts from every
supported contract version.

#### SDK ↔ contract version support

An SDK release operates only accounts created with its pinned contract version;
the mapping is in
[`MIDEN_COMPATIBILITY.md`](./MIDEN_COMPATIBILITY.md#support-matrix).

Compatibility there is about the on-chain account, not Guardian's stored state.
Adopting a new Miden line has twice required an irreversible server-side reset, so
even an account whose contract version still matches must be re-registered
afterwards. See
[`MIDEN_COMPATIBILITY.md`](./MIDEN_COMPATIBILITY.md#data-resets).

Both SDKs **enforce** this at runtime rather than trusting the table: before any
procedure-root-keyed storage read, the account's code is checked for the pinned
contract version's auth procedure (`auth_tx_guarded_multisig`). A mismatch fails
loudly — Rust `MultisigError::UnsupportedContractVersion` (from
`MultisigAccount::procedure_threshold` and everything built on it), TS an
`unsupported contract version` error from `AccountInspector.fromAccount` — instead
of silently reporting wrong thresholds. `MultisigAccount::is_pinned_contract_version()`
exposes the check directly. When a new contract version is adopted, add a row here
and regenerate the root constants in the same change.

## Releasing

Steps for publishing a new version of the SDK (Rust crates + TypeScript packages).

### Pre-Release Checklist

1. All tests pass:

```bash
# Rust
cargo test --locked \
  -p guardian-shared \
  -p guardian-client \
  -p miden-confidential-contracts \
  -p miden-multisig-client

# TypeScript
cd packages
npm ci
npm test -w @openzeppelin/guardian-client
npm test -w @openzeppelin/guardian-evm-client
npm test -w @openzeppelin/guardian-operator-client
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/guardian-client
npm test -w @openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client
```

2. TypeScript packages build cleanly:

```bash
cd packages
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/guardian-client
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/guardian-evm-client
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/guardian-operator-client
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client
```

3. Version numbers are updated in all files (see below).

4. The coordinated Rust publication archive passes:

```bash
cargo publish --dry-run --locked \
  -p guardian-shared \
  -p guardian-client \
  -p miden-confidential-contracts \
  -p miden-multisig-client
```

### Version Bump

Update the version in these files:

| File | Field | Inherits |
|------|-------|----------|
| `Cargo.toml` (workspace root) | `[workspace.package] version` | `shared`, `client`, `contracts`, `miden-multisig-client` |
| `crates/contracts/Cargo.toml` | `guardian-shared` dep version | - |
| `crates/client/Cargo.toml` | `guardian-shared` dep version | - |
| `crates/miden-multisig-client/Cargo.toml` | `guardian-client`, `guardian-shared`, `miden-confidential-contracts` dep versions | - |
| `packages/guardian-client/package.json` | `version` | - |
| `packages/guardian-evm-client/package.json` | `version` | - |
| `packages/guardian-operator-client/package.json` | `version` | - |
| `packages/miden-multisig-client/package.json` | `version` + `@openzeppelin/guardian-client` dep version | - |
| `packages/package-lock.json` | workspace lockfile | refresh with `npm install` in `packages/` |

The `server`, `miden-rpc-client`, `miden-keystore`, and example crates have their own independent versions and are not published.

After bumping TypeScript versions, refresh the workspace lockfile:

```bash
cd packages
npm install
```

The lockfile records a workspace link for `@openzeppelin/guardian-client`, not an npm tarball, so it does not need the new client version to exist on the registry.

### Publishing Rust Crates

Rust crates are published by the
[`Publish Rust Crates`](../.github/workflows/publish-crates.yml) workflow.
Publishing a GitHub Release automatically selects all four crates, validates
that the tag is `v` followed by their coordinated version, requests one
`release` environment approval, and uses crates.io trusted publishing. Cargo
receives all selected packages in one command and handles dependency-safe
publication.

Configure a crates.io trusted publisher for each crate before the first
automated publication:

```text
GitHub owner: OpenZeppelin
Repository: guardian
Workflow: publish-crates.yml
Environment: release
```

Use a manual dry run to validate one or more selected crates without requesting
approval or credentials:

```bash
gh workflow run publish-crates.yml \
  --ref main \
  -f dry-run=true \
  -f guardian-shared=true \
  -f guardian-client=true \
  -f miden-confidential-contracts=true \
  -f miden-multisig-client=true
```

A manual run with `dry-run=false` publishes only the selected crates after one
approval. If an unselected internal prerequisite is not already visible at the
exact coordinated version, validation fails before publication.

Publication is rerunnable. Exact versions already on crates.io are reported as
already published and omitted from the Cargo command. If a publication is
interrupted, rerun it; the preflight skips versions that reached crates.io and
Cargo processes the remainder. Trusted-publishing failure fails closed; the
workflow has no registry-token fallback.

### Publishing TypeScript Packages

Packages live in the `packages/` npm workspace. Install once from that directory, then publish in dependency order. `miden-multisig-client` links the in-repo `@openzeppelin/guardian-client`; the published `package.json` still carries the `^` version range for consumers.

```bash
cd packages
npm ci

# 1. Build TypeScript packages
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/guardian-client
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/guardian-evm-client
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/guardian-operator-client
npm run build -w @openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client

# 2. Publish base clients first (no internal deps)

Publishing a GitHub release runs the `Publish NPM Packages` workflow for all
four packages. A manual workflow run can select any subset of the four package
inputs; at least one package must be selected. The `dry-run` input applies only
to that selected subset. All selected packages run serially in one protected
`release` environment job, so the workflow requires one approval.

### Post-Release

1. Create a draft GitHub Release for review:

```bash
gh release create v<version> --generate-notes --draft
```

2. Publish the draft when the coordinated Rust, TypeScript, and server-image
   release workflows should start:

```bash
gh release edit v<version> --draft=false
```

3. Approve the `release` environment jobs that should publish. The Rust
   workflow summary records the source SHA, coordinated version,
   authentication mode, and ordered per-crate outcomes without credentials.
