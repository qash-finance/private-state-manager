# Local Development

How to run Guardian on a developer machine, what choices you have, and which
example to reach for once it's up.

For protocol concepts (State, Delta, Nonce, Commitment) read
[`spec/index.md`](../spec/index.md) first — this guide assumes you know them.
For the deployed AWS topology see
[`docs/architecture/infra.md`](./architecture/infra.md).

## What you're choosing

Three decisions when running Guardian locally:

1. **Storage backend** — filesystem (default) or Postgres. See
   [Storage modes](./architecture/services.md#storage-modes). Filesystem is
   fine for most local work; pick Postgres only if you are testing
   migrations, audit persistence, or multi-replica behavior.
2. **Cargo features** — `postgres` and/or `evm`. Default builds do
   **not** include EVM routes and do **not** include the Postgres backend.
3. **How to launch** — `cargo run` (fastest iteration) or
   `docker compose` (closer to the deployed shape).

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain pinned by [`rust-toolchain.toml`](../rust-toolchain.toml).
- Node 24+ (bundles npm 11, which the `packages/` workspace lockfile requires) if you will run any TS examples or packages.
- Docker if you will use `docker-compose.*.yml`.
- A Miden node — required for almost every flow. Either point at a
  Miden Devnet endpoint or run one locally; configure via
  `GUARDIAN_NETWORK_TYPE`. A node on a non-default host or port (for
  example a sidecar container) is reachable via
  `GUARDIAN_MIDEN_RPC_ENDPOINT` without changing the network type; see
  [CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md) for that and the optional
  `GUARDIAN_MIDEN_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS` / `GUARDIAN_MIDEN_RPC_MAX_ATTEMPTS`
  read-retry knobs. The node's Miden line must match the workspace
  baseline (currently the 0.16 pre-release line; devnet already runs
  the 0.16 node) — a mismatched node is rejected at the RPC boundary
  (see
  [Troubleshooting](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md#client-and-node-disagree-about-the-network-version)).

## Environment file

The server calls `dotenvy::dotenv()` on startup, so `cargo run --bin server`
automatically reads a root `.env` file when one exists. In practice a `.env`
file (or exported variables) is required: `GUARDIAN_NETWORK_TYPE` has no
default and the server refuses to start without it, and the built-in
filesystem paths live under `/var/guardian`, which may not exist or be
writable on a developer machine.

Minimal local `.env`:

```bash
GUARDIAN_STORAGE_PATH=.guardian/storage
GUARDIAN_METADATA_PATH=.guardian/metadata
GUARDIAN_KEYSTORE_PATH=.guardian/keystore
GUARDIAN_NETWORK_TYPE=MidenDevnet
RUST_LOG=info
```

Create the directories once before the first run:

```bash
mkdir -p .guardian/storage .guardian/metadata .guardian/keystore
```

Use `.env.example` as a broader template when you need deploy variables,
Postgres, dashboard operators, or EVM settings. Docker Compose does not inject
the root `.env` into the server container by default; the checked-in compose
file already sets the container filesystem paths.

## Path A — `cargo run` with filesystem (fastest)

```bash
cargo run --bin server
```

This builds with no extra features and uses the **filesystem** backend.
Useful env:

| Variable | Notes |
|---|---|
| `GUARDIAN_STORAGE_PATH` | Local path for state + deltas. Defaults to `/var/guardian/storage`. |
| `GUARDIAN_METADATA_PATH` | Local path for accounts, auth, network. Defaults to `/var/guardian/metadata`. |
| `GUARDIAN_KEYSTORE_PATH` | ACK key files, auto-generated on first run. Defaults to `/var/guardian/keystore`. |
| `RUST_LOG` (`info`) | `info`, `debug`, or e.g. `server::jobs::canonicalization=debug`. |
| `GUARDIAN_NETWORK_TYPE` (**required**) | Miden network name: `MidenLocal`, `MidenTestnet`, or `MidenDevnet`. The server refuses to start when it is unset or unrecognized. |

At startup the server emits a warning that audit events will **not** be
persisted — that's expected for filesystem mode
([`builder/storage.rs:133`](../crates/server/src/builder/storage.rs#L133)).

The HTTP server binds on `:3000`, gRPC on `:50051`.

## Path B — `cargo run` with Postgres

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d

DATABASE_URL=postgres://guardian:guardian@localhost:5432/guardian \
  cargo run -p guardian-server --features postgres --bin server
```

The Postgres path runs SQL migrations on startup
([`builder/storage.rs`](../crates/server/src/builder/storage.rs)) and
wires `PostgresAuditor` so admin actions land in the `admin_actions` table.
Pool sizing is controlled by `GUARDIAN_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` and
`GUARDIAN_METADATA_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE`.

### Postgres-backed tests

The `guardian-server` tests that need a live database (metadata replay state,
delta storage fencing, the audit append-only trigger, and the lease, session,
and challenge coordination stores) stay `#[ignore]` and run through one script:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=guardian docker compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d postgres
./scripts/test-postgres.sh
```

Name the `postgres` service explicitly: an unqualified `up -d` also builds and
starts the server image, which these tests do not use. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is
required even when only the database service is selected, because Compose
interpolates the whole file; the script's default connection URL expects
`guardian`. If your Compose volume was initialised with a different password,
pass a matching `DATABASE_URL` instead of relying on the default.

The suite drops and recreates the `public` schema before the first test and
re-applies every migration from empty, so no run inherits state from an earlier
one and there is no cleanup step. It creates `guardian_test` if it is missing,
and it refuses to run against a database whose name does not end in `_test`, so
a `DATABASE_URL` still exported from a Path B session cannot lose your
development data. Point it elsewhere with:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:5432/guardian_test ./scripts/test-postgres.sh
```

Run one suite at a time per server: the reset wipes the shared test database.
Execution is serial because one test reverts the newest migration for the
duration of its own run.

The local compose Postgres uses no TLS, so omit `sslmode` (plaintext). To
exercise certificate verification locally, run a TLS-enabled Postgres with a
self-signed CA and point the server at it:

```bash
# Generate a CA and a server cert whose SAN matches the connection host
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout ca.key -out ca.pem \
  -subj "/CN=Test CA" -days 3650
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.csr \
  -subj "/CN=localhost" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost"
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out server.crt -days 3650 -copy_extensions copyall
# start postgres with ssl=on using server.crt/server.key, then:

# verify-full: chain + hostname (SAN must be localhost)
DATABASE_URL="postgres://guardian:guardian@localhost:5432/guardian?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=$PWD/ca.pem" \
  cargo run -p guardian-server --features postgres --bin server

# verify-ca: chain only (hostname not checked)
DATABASE_URL="postgres://guardian:guardian@localhost:5432/guardian?sslmode=verify-ca&sslrootcert=$PWD/ca.pem" \
  cargo run -p guardian-server --features postgres --bin server
```

Expected: correct CA + matching SAN → starts; wrong/empty CA file → fails fast
with a certificate error; under `verify-full` a SAN ≠ `localhost` is refused
while the same cert is accepted under `verify-ca`. See the full matrix in
[CONFIGURATION.md → Database TLS](./CONFIGURATION.md#database-tls).

## Path C — `cargo run` with EVM support

```bash
GUARDIAN_EVM_RPC_URLS=31337=http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
GUARDIAN_EVM_ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS=0x... \
  cargo run -p guardian-server --features evm --bin server
```

EVM routes (`/evm/auth/*`, `/evm/accounts`, `/evm/proposals*`) only register
when the `evm` feature is on. Combine with `postgres` for prod-like local
setups: `--features postgres,evm`. Pair with an Anvil node — the
`smoke-test-evm-proposal-support` skill walks through the full flow.

## Path D — Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f
```

This is the default Compose flow — **filesystem backend**, no Postgres, no
root `.env` required. For a Postgres-backed compose stack use
`docker-compose.postgres.yml`. Endpoints are the same as Path A (`:3000`,
`:50051`).

## Choosing a feature flag combo

| Goal | Features | Backend |
|---|---|---|
| Hack on a service handler quickly | _none_ | filesystem |
| Touch migrations, audit, or multi-replica behavior | `postgres` | Postgres |
| Exercise the EVM proposal flow | `evm` | filesystem |
| Reproduce a prod issue locally | `postgres,evm` | Postgres |
| Run the operator dashboard | _any_ | either (Postgres for durable history) |

The deploy script builds with `postgres,evm` when the EVM stack is requested
— see [`SERVER_AWS_DEPLOY.md`](./SERVER_AWS_DEPLOY.md#quick-start).

## Verifying the server is up

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/                   # liveness (alias of /status)
curl http://localhost:3000/pubkey             # ACK key commitment
grpcurl -plaintext \
  -import-path crates/server/proto -proto guardian.proto \
  -d '{}' localhost:50051 guardian.Guardian/GetPubkey
```

If `GetPubkey` returns a key, the server is wired correctly and the gRPC
target group's health check
([`infra/alb.tf:55`](../infra/alb.tf#L55)) would pass in production.

## Reaching for an example

| Example | What it exercises | SDK |
|---|---|---|
| [`examples/demo`](../examples/demo/README.md) | End-to-end multisig flow in a Rust TUI — recommended starting point. | Rust multisig client |
| [`examples/rust`](../examples/rust/README.md) | Low-level Rust binaries for both local-node and mockchain flows. | Rust client |
| [`examples/smoke-web`](../examples/smoke-web/README.md) | Browser harness for multisig + wallet integrations. | TS multisig client |
| [`examples/operator-smoke-web`](../examples/operator-smoke-web/README.md) | Local Falcon operator login + dashboard account APIs. | `@openzeppelin/guardian-operator-client` |
| [`examples/evm-smoke-web`](../examples/evm-smoke-web/README.md) | EVM proposal lifecycle against Anvil + an EVM-enabled server. | `@openzeppelin/guardian-evm-client` |
| [`examples/web`](../examples/web/README.md) | Reference web integration. | TS multisig client |

Follow each example's README to drive it manually. Agents in this repo
have matching skills (`smoke-test-rust-multisig-sdk`,
`smoke-test-ts-multisig-sdk`, `smoke-test-operator-dashboard`,
`smoke-test-evm-proposal-support`) that automate the same flows.

## Running tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo test -p guardian-server --features integration
cargo test -p guardian-server --features e2e
```

TypeScript packages live in an npm workspace under `packages/`. Install
once from that directory with `npm ci`, then run tests with
`npm test -w @openzeppelin/<package>`. `miden-multisig-client` depends
on the in-repo `guardian-client` workspace package — build that first.
See the root [`README.md`](../README.md#typescript-tests).

Cargo feature gates (`integration`, `e2e`) document what each suite
needs at the top of the relevant test modules under
[`crates/server/src/testing`](../crates/server/src/testing). Agents in
this repo have a `guardian-validation-matrix` skill that picks the
smallest meaningful set for a given change.

## Common gotchas

- **`DATABASE_URL` missing under `--features postgres`** — the builder
  fails fast with `"DATABASE_URL environment variable is required"`
  ([`builder/storage.rs:97`](../crates/server/src/builder/storage.rs#L97)).
- **Filesystem dirs don't exist** — the server creates them on demand, but
  the parent path must be writable.
- **ACK keypair changes between runs in filesystem mode** — keys
  auto-generate on first start. If clients pinned an old pubkey, point them
  at the new one or persist the keystore directory.
- **gRPC reflection over Cloudflare** — works locally but Cloudflare's
  free tier rejects gRPC unless explicitly enabled on the zone.
- **Apple Silicon + `--platform linux/amd64`** — slow but works. For
  faster local Docker builds, build `linux/arm64` images and deploy with
  `cpu_architecture = "ARM64"`.
