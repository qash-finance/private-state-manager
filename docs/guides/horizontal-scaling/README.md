# Horizontal scaling: two replicas behind a proxy

Run two Guardian replicas behind a round-robin proxy, sharing one Postgres, and
watch the coordination layer (issue #242) work end to end on your laptop. This
mirrors the prod topology — 2–6 ECS tasks behind a load balancer — in miniature.

```

Everything that must be shared for a correct multi-replica deployment lives in
Postgres, so a session minted on one replica is honored on the other, and only
one replica ever canonicalizes. The variable meanings live in
[`../../CONFIGURATION.md`](../../CONFIGURATION.md); the operational contract is in
[`../../runbooks/horizontal-scaling.md`](../../runbooks/horizontal-scaling.md).

## Prerequisites

- Docker with Compose v2 (`docker compose`).
- The Rust toolchain and `jq`, used once to generate the shared ACK signing
  keys (next section).
- No AWS anywhere. The replicas share one Guardian identity through two local
  key files (`GUARDIAN_ACK_SECRET_PROVIDER=file`) — the non-AWS stable identity
  from [issue #289](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/guardian/issues/289).

## Configure and run

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Set a real cursor secret — it MUST be identical on every replica:
#   openssl rand -hex 32   →   paste into GUARDIAN_DASHBOARD_CURSOR_SECRET
cp operators.example.json operators.json   # empty allowlist `[]`; add a key for the login walkthrough (step 8)
```

Generate **one** ACK keypair that both replicas mount (this is the fleet's
Guardian identity — see [What is shared](#what-is-shared-and-why)). The files
must be owner-only or the server refuses to start:

```sh
mkdir -p ack-keys
cargo run --quiet -p guardian-server --bin ack-keygen \
  | { read -r json; \
      jq -rj '.falcon_secret_key' <<<"$json" > ack-keys/ack-falcon-secret-key; \
      jq -rj '.ecdsa_secret_key'  <<<"$json" > ack-keys/ack-ecdsa-secret-key; }
chmod 600 ack-keys/ack-falcon-secret-key ack-keys/ack-ecdsa-secret-key
```

`ack-keys/` is git-ignored. Treat it like any private key material — and note
that regenerating it changes the Guardian's identity, freezing any multisig
account that pinned the old one (see the
[secrets runbook](../../runbooks/secrets.md#self-hosted-stable-identity-without-aws)).

The proxy is at <http://localhost:8080>. Each replica is also exposed directly —
`server-a` on `:3000`, `server-b` on `:3010` — so you can target a specific
replica during the walkthrough. Postgres is on `:5432`.

gRPC mirrors the HTTP layout: the proxy round-robins plaintext gRPC (h2c) on
`:50051` — which is the Rust demo CLI's default endpoint, so its `[1] Local
gRPC` choice goes through the load balancer — with the replicas reachable
directly on `:50052` (A) and `:50053` (B).

## What is shared (and why)

| Shared in Postgres | Table | Effect across replicas |
|---|---|---|
| Operator/EVM sessions | `auth_sessions` | Log in on A, your cookie works on B; logout is honored fleet-wide. |
| Login challenges | `auth_challenges` | A challenge is single-use even if issued on A and verified on B. |
| Canonicalization lease | `worker_leases` | Exactly one replica promotes candidates; the others stand by. |
| Replay protection | `account_auth_state` | A request timestamp accepted on A cannot be replayed to B; each per-account-and-signer timestamp is usable exactly once fleet-wide. A retained migration floor also protects signers first authorized after an account-scoped upgrade. |

Coordination is **backend-derived**: it is on because the backend is Postgres.
No environment variable enables or disables it.

**Upgrading across schema migrations**: migrations run automatically at
startup, and the first replica to boot a new binary migrates the shared
database for the whole fleet. Migrations that move authentication state lock
the affected table for their transaction, so replay timestamps accepted by
old replicas are never lost mid-migration — old-binary writes either land
before the migration's snapshot or fail on the schema change. A replica still
running the previous binary therefore fails closed — its queries name columns
the migration removed, so it serves errors instead of authenticating against
stale state — until it is replaced. Plan rolling deploys accordingly: old
replicas may error (never misbehave) during the window between the first
new-binary boot and the last replica replacement.

One shared thing lives **outside** Postgres: the ACK signing keys. Both
replicas mount the same `./ack-keys` files and load them via
`GUARDIAN_ACK_SECRET_PROVIDER=file`, so the fleet presents a single,
restart-stable Guardian identity at `/pubkey`. That matters for multisig: each
account pins the guardian's `/pubkey` commitment into its
`openzeppelin::guardian::public_key` slot at configure time, and a replica
whose identity doesn't match rejects co-signing with `invalid GUARDIAN public
key binding`. With per-replica ephemeral keys (the non-prod default), routing
multisig through the proxy would fail on every request the "wrong" replica
answered.

## Validation walkthrough

### 1. Both replicas report shared coordination

```sh
docker compose logs server-a server-b | grep -i coordination
```

Each replica prints one line; both must read `mode=shared backend=postgres`. If
you ever see `mode=single-process backend=filesystem`, that replica is **not**
safe to run alongside others.

### 2. One Guardian identity across the fleet

```sh
diff <(curl -s http://localhost:3000/pubkey) <(curl -s http://localhost:3010/pubkey) \
  && echo "identical"
```

Both replicas serve a byte-identical `/pubkey` response because they load the
same `./ack-keys` files, and the identity survives restarts: `docker compose
restart server-a` and run the diff again — still identical. (Remove the
`GUARDIAN_ACK_*` variables from `docker-compose.yml` and each replica mints its
own ephemeral key per boot; the diff then fails and multisig through the proxy
breaks — see [What is shared](#what-is-shared-and-why).)

### 3. Exactly one canonicalization lease holder

```sh
docker compose exec postgres \
  psql -U guardian -d guardian \
  -c "select lease_name, holder_id, fence_token from worker_leases;"
```

You get a single `canonicalization` row with one `holder_id` (formatted
`{pid}-{random}`) — never two. Both replicas run the worker loop, but only the
lease holder does work; the other keeps trying to acquire and backs off.

### 4. Lease failover with a fencing-token bump

Stop the current holder and watch a different replica take over within the lease
TTL (~30s, i.e. 3× the 10s canonicalization interval):

```sh
docker compose stop server-a       # if A wasn't the holder, stop server-b instead
watch -n2 'docker compose exec -T postgres \
  psql -U guardian -d guardian \
  -c "select holder_id, fence_token, expires_at from worker_leases;"'
```

`holder_id` changes to the surviving replica and `fence_token` **increments** —
the increment is the steal signal a superseded holder uses to fence itself off
at its next write. Bring the replica back with `docker compose start server-a`;
the lease does not bounce back (the current holder keeps renewing).

### 5. Proxy request failover

The lease failover above is server-side; the proxy also has to stop routing
*client* requests to a dead replica. That is what the `health_uri` / `lb_*`
directives in the [`Caddyfile`](./Caddyfile) do — a bare `round_robin` (no health
checks) keeps sending half the traffic to the dead replica and returns `502`.
Kill a replica and hit the proxy:

```sh
docker compose stop server-b
for i in $(seq 1 4); do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} " \
  http://localhost:8080/pubkey; done; echo
```

Every response stays `200` — Caddy health-checks each replica and routes only to
the survivor. Bring it back with `docker compose start server-b`; Caddy re-adds
it within one health interval (~5s). (Strip the health directives from the
`Caddyfile` and the same loop returns alternating `502`s.)

### 6. Auth fails closed when the shared store is down

Pause Postgres and watch the holder step down rather than barrel ahead:

```sh
docker compose pause postgres
docker compose logs -f server-a server-b   # Ctrl-C after a few seconds
```

You will see lease renew/acquire failures and storage errors — the worker
**cancels its pass** instead of canonicalizing blind. If you have completed the
login walkthrough below, an authenticated request fails rather than silently
succeeding: authentication is **fail-closed**.

> `docker compose pause` freezes Postgres mid-connection (SIGSTOP), so an
> in-flight request *hangs until it times out* rather than getting a prompt
> `5xx`. Either way it never succeeds. To see a fast `5xx` instead (socket
> closed → connection refused), use `docker compose stop postgres` and
> `docker compose start postgres` to recover.

Recover with:

```sh
docker compose unpause postgres
```

Coordination resumes automatically; no manual intervention.

### 7. Rate-limit partitioning and `X-Forwarded-For`

Each replica enforces `global / GUARDIAN_MAX_REPLICAS`. With the default global
burst of 10 and `GUARDIAN_MAX_REPLICAS=2`, a single replica caps at ~5 req/s.
Hammer one replica directly (the challenge endpoint is unauthenticated and
rate-limited):

```sh
for i in $(seq 1 12); do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code} " \
    "http://localhost:3000/auth/challenge?commitment=0xdemo"
done; echo
```

After the per-replica burst is spent you see `429`s. Through the proxy
(`:8080`), Caddy sets `X-Forwarded-For`, so the server keys the limit on your
real client IP rather than the proxy address — confirm by repeating the loop
against `http://localhost:8080/...` and seeing the same per-IP behavior.

### 8. (End-to-end) An operator session survives losing its replica

This is the headline, and it needs a real operator key to sign the challenge.
Use the [`examples/operator-smoke-web`](../../../examples/operator-smoke-web)
harness (or the operator client) pointed at the **proxy** URL
`http://localhost:8080`:

1. Generate a Falcon operator key with the harness and add its public key to
   `operators.json` (replacing the empty `[]`); the allowlist hot-reloads, so no
   restart is needed:

   ```json
   [{ "public_key": "0x<falcon-operator-pubkey>", "permissions": ["dashboard:read"] }]
   ```
2. Complete the login (`GET /auth/challenge` → sign → `POST
   /auth/verify`). The proxy round-robins, so this may land on either
   replica; the session row is written to `auth_sessions`.
3. Make an authenticated request (e.g. `GET /dashboard/accounts`) a few times —
   each may be served by a different replica, and all succeed: the cookie is
   validated against the shared store, not per-process memory.
4. Now `docker compose stop` the replica that handled your login and repeat —
   **your session still works** on the survivor. Then `POST
   /auth/logout`; the revocation is honored on every replica.

## Cleanup

```sh
docker compose down -v        # -v also drops the Postgres + keystore volumes
```

`./ack-keys` is a host directory, so `down -v` leaves it alone — keep it and the
Guardian identity survives a full teardown. Delete it only to discard that
identity for good (any account configured against it would need a
`SwitchGuardian` migration).

## From this demo to production

This guide stays AWS-free to be runnable; a real prod deployment differs in two
ways that do not change the coordination behavior shown above:

- **`GUARDIAN_ENV=prod`** activates the prod-stage startup guards — a filesystem
  storage backend and a rate limit that partitions to 0 req/replica are each
  refused at startup. (An unset `GUARDIAN_DASHBOARD_CURSOR_SECRET` only *warns* —
  it degrades cross-replica pagination on the dashboard feeds and the client `/delta/history` endpoint, not custody, so a
  single-replica prod server still boots.) Note these guards live behind the ACK
  registry init, which in prod requires AWS first: set `GUARDIAN_ENV=prod`
  without `AWS_REGION` and the server refuses to start with `AWS_REGION is
  required when GUARDIAN_ENV=prod` before it ever reaches the storage or
  rate-limit checks — so observing those two specifically needs AWS configured.
- **Where the shared ACK key lives.** Both setups give the fleet one guardian
  identity — the property multisig needs, since each account pins the
  guardian's `/pubkey` commitment at configure time. This guide sources it from
  two local files (`GUARDIAN_ACK_SECRET_PROVIDER=file`, the `./ack-keys` bind
  mount); prod sources the same key material from AWS Secrets Manager
  (`GUARDIAN_ENV=prod` defaults the provider to `aws`), so no secret sits on a
  task's disk. The formats are identical — the hex strings `ack-keygen` emits —
  so keys are portable between the two providers; see the
  [aws-signers guide](../aws-signers/README.md) and the
  [secrets runbook](../../runbooks/secrets.md#ack-signing-keys). Per-account
  state already lives in Postgres and needs nothing extra.

The managed path (published Postgres image + the prod Terraform profile) sets
all of this for you; see [`../../SERVER_AWS_DEPLOY.md`](../../SERVER_AWS_DEPLOY.md)
