# Guardian Concepts

A conceptual introduction to Guardian. Read this **before** the architecture
docs if you are new to the system — it explains what Guardian is, what it is
*not*, and the trust model that informs every other decision in the
codebase.

For formal definitions and wire shapes, see [`spec/`](../spec/index.md). For
the module-level decomposition, see
[`docs/architecture/services.md`](./architecture/services.md).

## What Guardian is

Guardian is an **off-chain coordination service** for Miden accounts. It
stores account state snapshots and the deltas that mutate them, signs
accepted deltas with an acknowledgement key, and helps multiple clients of
the same account stay in sync.

Guardian is:

- **Non-custodial.** It never holds an account's spending key. The account
  owner does.
- **Not the source of truth.** The Miden network remains authoritative for
  account commitments. Guardian's database is a *coordination cache*, not a
  ledger.
- **Pluggable.** Server, clients, and the multisig SDK are all in this
  repository; operators can run Guardian themselves, and users can rotate
  away from any operator at any time.

## The custody spectrum

Traditional crypto custody is binary — either a full custodian holds the
key, or the user does. Guardian creates a third position — but **not** by
holding a seat in the user's multisig. The account component enforces two
independent checks on every ordinary transaction:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph S["User signer set"]
    H["Hot key<br/>(daily transactions)"]
    C["Cold key<br/>(recovery, offline)"]
  end
  T["M-of-N threshold<br/>(user keys only)"]
  G["Guardian check<br/>(one ACK signature —<br/>never counted toward M)"]
  B{"Both must pass"}
  A["Transaction authorized"]
  H --> T
  C --> T
  T --> B
  G --> B
  B --> A
```

- **The user threshold** counts only the user's signer set. The Guardian
  key is stored in a separate storage slot and can never satisfy or
  contribute to M.
- **The Guardian check** verifies exactly one Guardian signature over the
  same transaction summary the cosigners sign. It is a pass/fail gate:
  the Guardian can veto a transaction by withholding its ACK, but its
  signature alone authorizes nothing — **Guardian alone can never move
  funds**.
- **The rotation exception.** The one transaction the account component
  executes without the Guardian check is `SwitchGuardian` (rotating the
  Guardian key), which needs only the user threshold. Guardian's blocking
  power is therefore temporary and defeasible: the user's own keys can
  always remove it.

So the Guardian participates in every ordinary transaction, but as a
separate authentication input — not as one of the M counted signatures.
Describing the account as "2-of-3" (user hot, user cold, Guardian)
understates the user threshold's independence and overstates Guardian's
authority; the accurate description is *M-of-N over user keys, plus a
removable Guardian gate*.

## State and Delta

The two primitives Guardian works with:

- **State** — a snapshot of an account at a point in time. Guardian
  tracks the account ID, current commitment, nonce, and authentication
  scheme. The full state payload is opaque to Guardian; the client
  supplies it.
- **Delta** — an append-only change to that state. Every delta
  references the previous commitment (`prev_commitment`) and produces a
  new one, forming an unbroken chain.

These mirror the definitions in
[`spec/index.md`](../spec/index.md#definitions). The supporting concepts
are:

| Term | Role |
|---|---|
| **Commitment** | Hash uniquely identifying a state version. Lets clients detect tampering. |
| **Nonce** | Monotonically increasing counter — orders deltas in the chain. |
| **Account ID** | Unique identifier; one Guardian hosts many accounts. |
| **Delta proposal** | Multi-party coordination object — sits in `pending` until threshold cosigners have signed. |
| **Acknowledgement (ACK)** | Guardian's signature over an accepted delta's transaction summary commitment — the same message the cosigners sign. Issued only after Guardian has validated the delta against the stored state. Clients verify the ACK to confirm a delta was actually accepted by the Guardian they expected. |

## Transaction lifecycle

A single transaction touches Guardian and the Miden network in five steps:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User device
  participant G as Guardian
  participant M as Miden network

  U->>U: 1. Execute transaction locally, compute delta
  U->>G: 2. Submit signed delta (prev_commitment, nonce, payload)
  G->>G: validate against stored state
  G-->>U: 3. ACK signature over the transaction summary commitment<br/>(delta status: candidate)
  U->>M: 4. Submit proven account update
  M-->>U: account commitment accepted
  G->>M: poll for canonical commitment
  G->>G: 5. If commitments match, mark canonical — otherwise park as<br/>retained and keep reconciling until it matches or the TTL expires
```

The status transitions for a delta:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `candidate` | Guardian accepted and signed it, but the matching Miden update has not yet been observed. |
| `canonical` | Guardian observed the matching commitment on Miden. The delta is now durable for other clients of the same account. |
| `retained` | Guardian stopped actively verifying the candidate and released the account slot. The on-chain outcome remains **uncertain**; background reconciliation may still promote it to `canonical` until its retention TTL expires (default 24 h). A new submission at the same nonce supersedes it. Never read `retained` as "the transaction did not land" — it means *unlocked but unresolved*. |
| `discarded` | Canonicalization was abandoned by the client (`client_abandoned`), or retention is disabled and verification failed terminally. The client must rebuild from the latest canonical state. |

This single definition of `retained` holds across every surface —
canonicalization, account locking, the abandon APIs (which report a
distinct `retained` result, never `abandoned`), the SDKs, and the
operator dashboard. At a glance:

| Status | Account locked? | Outcome known? | Client action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `candidate` | Yes | No | Wait, or request abandonment |
| `retained` | No | No | Sync and check the chain before replacing (a resubmission supersedes the row and forfeits automatic recovery) |
| `discarded` (`client_abandoned`) | No | Probably not landed, but late reconciliation remains possible within the TTL | Continue cautiously |
| `canonical` | No | Yes — landed | Sync account state |

This is the **canonicalization** process. The default `candidate` mode runs
a background worker that polls Miden and promotes or discards each
candidate. An `optimistic` mode promotes immediately and is appropriate
only when the client and operator trust each other absolutely (e.g.
single-tenant dev setups). See [`spec/processes.md`](../spec/processes.md#canonicalization)
for the formal state machine.

## Trust model

Guardian's trust boundaries layer up like this:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph L1["1. Client → Guardian"]
    L1d["signed delta, signed request,<br/>timestamp, payload digest"]
  end
  subgraph L2["2. Guardian → Client"]
    L2d["ACK-signed delta,<br/>commitment chain"]
  end
  subgraph L3["3. Client → Miden"]
    L3d["ZK-proven account update"]
  end
  subgraph L4["4. Guardian → Miden"]
    L4d["read-only commitment queries"]
  end
  subgraph L5["5. Inside Guardian"]
    L5d["snapshots, deltas, proposals,<br/>metadata, audit log"]
  end

  Client --> L1 --> L2 --> Client
  Client --> L3 --> Miden
  Guardian --> L4 --> Miden
  Guardian --> L5
```

| Boundary | Protected by |
|---|---|
| Client → Guardian | Per-account Falcon/ECDSA signatures, replay protection (±5 min timestamp window + monotonic per-key timestamps), rate limits, request size limits. |
| Guardian → Client | The ACK signature on every accepted delta. Clients verify the ACK and the commitment chain before trusting returned state. |
| Client → Miden | Miden's own ZK proof verification; Guardian is not in this path. |
| Guardian → Miden | Read-only RPC; Miden does not trust Guardian for anything. |
| Inside Guardian | Backend access control, IAM scoping, infrastructure hardening — see [`docs/runbooks/secrets.md`](./runbooks/secrets.md) and [`docs/architecture/infra.md`](./architecture/infra.md). |

What this means in practice:

- **A compromised Guardian cannot steal funds.** It can refuse service or
  serve stale data, but it cannot produce a Miden-accepted update without
  the user's spending key.
- **A compromised Guardian can withhold or lie about state.** Clients are
  expected to compare against Miden before signing anything important.
- **An offline Guardian halts coordination.** Users can still execute
  locally; they just cannot sync with their other devices, and other
  cosigners cannot see their proposals.

## Client verification checklist

When integrating an SDK against a Guardian, clients **must**:

1. **Pin Guardian's pubkey** — fetch `/pubkey` once over a trusted channel
   and refuse to talk to any Guardian that returns a different key.
2. **Verify the ACK signature** on every accepted delta before treating it
   as confirmed.
3. **Validate the commitment chain** — `delta_n.new_commitment` must match
   `delta_{n+1}.prev_commitment`. A break means Guardian is lying or
   corrupted.
4. **Check freshness against Miden** before signing high-value
   transactions — match the latest canonical commitment against the
   account's commitment on-chain.
5. **Treat unexpected pubkey changes as security events.** The Guardian
   you connected to last week should be the same Guardian today. If it
   isn't, halt operations until you can confirm intentional rotation.

The Rust and TypeScript multisig SDKs perform 1–4 automatically; #5 is an
application-level decision.

## Failure and recovery

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  F1["Guardian unavailable"] --> R1["Use local state · retry · rotate provider"]
  F2["Candidate fails canonicalization"] --> R2["Resync from latest canonical · rebuild transaction"]
  F3["Stale delta submission<br/>(prev_commitment mismatch)"] --> R3["Fetch /delta/since · replay canonical deltas · retry"]
  F4["Operator withholds updates"] --> R4["Compare against Miden · rotate Guardian<br/>(user threshold)"]
  F5["Guardian database corruption"] --> R5["Reject unverifiable data · recover from another device or operator"]
```

| Failure | What you see | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Guardian unreachable | gRPC `Unavailable` / HTTP 5xx, no ACK | Continue locally, retry; rotate operator if persistent. |
| Stale delta (`commitment_mismatch`) | `400` with `code: commitment_mismatch` | `GET /delta/since` → replay canonical chain → retry the local transaction. |
| Candidate parked (`retained`) | Delta status flips `candidate` → `retained`; the account is released | Usually means the Miden proof was never submitted, the on-chain commitment diverged, or the guardian's RPC view lagged. No action is strictly required: if the transaction actually landed, the guardian reconciles and promotes it automatically. To move on immediately, refetch state, rebuild and resubmit — a new submission at the same nonce supersedes the retained delta. Because superseding forfeits that automatic recovery, check the delta's status once before resubmitting: if it already flipped to `canonical`, the original transaction landed and there is nothing to redo. |
| Transaction died after approval (stranded candidate) | New proposals answered `409 conflict_pending_delta` while the candidate waits out the grace + retry window | Call `POST /delta/candidate/abandon` (SDKs: `abandonCandidate` / `abandon_candidate`). The worker confirms over a short quarantine that the transaction did not land, flips the delta to `discarded` with reason `client_abandoned`, and releases the account — typically well under a minute. Poll via `abandonStatus` / `abandon_status`. |
| Operator censors / withholds | Other cosigners see stale state | Rotate Guardian by meeting the applicable user threshold (the cold key can participate); the new operator inherits canonical state from Miden. |
| Guardian database corruption (or restore from an older backup) | Accounts whose on-chain commitment advanced past the stored state fail state verification; accounts onboarded after the restore point fail with `account_not_found` because no guardian record remains | For an advanced account, a device holding the newer state re-syncs it, or rotate to another operator. For a missing account, a device holding it re-onboards via `/configure`, which re-registers the account with the state that device holds. The guardian cannot regenerate lost deltas because guarded accounts are private. |
| Account paused by operator | State-transition, proposal, and EVM mutation paths return `409 GUARDIAN_ACCOUNT_PAUSED` with `paused_reason` (reads and `ConfigureAccount` keep working) | Operator-driven safety lever, not a fault. An operator with `accounts:pause` clears it via `POST /dashboard/accounts/{id}/unpause`. See [`DASHBOARD.md`](./DASHBOARD.md#account-pausing). |
| Account switched to another guardian | After the `switch_guardian` delta canonicalizes on this server, mutation paths return `409 GUARDIAN_ACCOUNT_RELEASED` with `released_at` (reads and `ConfigureAccount` keep working); the dashboard shows `released_at` | Expected outcome of a guardian switch, not a fault. Terminal until the wallet re-onboards via `/configure`, which re-validates the guardian binding. An operator unpause never reactivates a released account. |
| Pubkey changed unexpectedly | `/pubkey` returns a key your client doesn't pin | Treat as compromise. Halt, verify rotation through an out-of-band channel. |

## Provider rotation

Because Guardian is non-custodial and Miden is the source of truth, users
who can meet their account's signing threshold can switch from one Guardian
operator to another without the current operator's cooperation:

1. Stand up (or contract with) a new Guardian instance.
2. Meet the applicable user threshold to execute the `SwitchGuardian`
   transaction, which installs the new Guardian service key in the
   account's Guardian slot. This is the rotation exception
   described above: the account component accepts it without the current
   Guardian's signature.
3. Point clients at the new endpoint and pubkey.

The multisig SDK's `SwitchGuardian` flow implements this. See
[`docs/MULTISIG_SDK.md`](./MULTISIG_SDK.md).

## What Guardian is *not*

To avoid confusion when reading the architecture docs:

- **Not a custodian.** Cannot move funds.
- **Not a node.** Does not validate Miden transactions. It signs *deltas*
  (off-chain state changes); Miden verifies the on-chain proof.
- **Not authoritative.** If Guardian and Miden disagree, Miden wins.
  Guardian discards mismatched candidates by design.
- **Not a TEE-only system.** Reproducible builds make TEE deployment
  *possible* but the reference deployment runs on ECS/Fargate, not in a
  TEE.
- **Not a privacy layer.** Guardian operators can see metadata (account
  IDs, timestamps, delta size, frequency). Payload privacy comes from
  Miden's ZK execution, not from Guardian.
