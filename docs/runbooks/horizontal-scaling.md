# Runbook: Horizontal Scaling (multiple Guardian replicas)

Guardian runs as 2–6 ECS tasks behind a round-robin load balancer in the prod
profile. This runbook covers what an operator must configure for a correct
high-availability (HA) deployment and how the server behaves across replicas.
Tracking: issue #242.

## TL;DR — required for a correct multi-replica deployment

| Setting | Why it matters across replicas |
|---|---|
| **Postgres backend** (`DATABASE_URL`) | Sessions, login challenges, and the canonicalization lease live in Postgres so they are shared. The filesystem backend is **dev-only** and is refused at startup in the prod stage. |
| **`GUARDIAN_DASHBOARD_CURSOR_SECRET`** (64 hex chars) | Pagination cursors are signed with this key. The prod Terraform profile injects one pre-created Secrets Manager value into every task. Outside that profile, an unset value makes the server **warn** and generate an ephemeral per-process secret; this degrades pagination across replicas, not custody. |
| **`GUARDIAN_ENV=prod`** | Activates the prod-stage startup guards (filesystem-backend refusal, 0-req/replica rate-limit refusal). Set by Terraform from `var.deployment_stage`. |
| **`GUARDIAN_MAX_REPLICAS`** | Rate-limit partitioning divisor (see below). Defaults from the autoscaling max capacity via Terraform. |

With the published Postgres image + the prod Terraform profile, all of these are
set for you after the one-time cursor-secret bootstrap:

```bash
DEPLOY_STAGE=prod STACK_NAME=<stack> ./scripts/aws-deploy.sh bootstrap-dashboard-cursor-secret
```

Normal deploys require that secret to exist and never create or rotate it. The
rest of this doc is for understanding and for non-default deployments.

## Coordination is backend-derived (not a tunable)

The coordination mode is determined by the **storage backend alone**:

- **Postgres backend → shared coordination** (replica-safe). Always. No tunable
  can turn this off — a missing or wrong env var can never silently revert a
  Postgres deployment to per-process state.
- **Filesystem backend → in-memory, single-process** coordination (dev only).

The startup log emits one line reflecting the resolved state, e.g.:

```text
coordination mode=shared backend=postgres stage=prod max_replicas=6 cursor_secret=configured
```

If you ever see `mode=single-process backend=filesystem` on a deployment you
believe is multi-replica, that deployment is **not** safe to run with more than
one task.

If the server is auto-built with the Postgres backend but coordination handles
were not wired (only possible via a manual/embedded builder), it **fails to
start** rather than falling back to per-process state.

## Behavior across replicas

- **Operator & EVM login**: a challenge issued on one replica verifies on any
  other; an established session is honored everywhere; logout and expiry are
  effective fleet-wide.
- **Canonicalization** runs on exactly one replica at a time via a Postgres
  lease (`worker_leases`). Leadership transfers automatically to another replica
  within one lease TTL (≈ 3× the canonicalization check interval) if the holder
  crashes. Every canonicalization write (promotion, discard, retry bookkeeping)
  validates the holder's fencing token against the lease row at its database
  write boundary and only touches deltas still in candidate status. A write
  that validated immediately before a leadership transfer may finish afterward;
  account-level serialization and conditional state/candidate updates make that
  overlap safe without globally locking the lease row. Promotion itself is
  atomic — account state, cosigner auth sync, the candidate→canonical flip, and
  the pending-candidate flag release commit together or not at all. A *planned*
  stop (deploy,
  scale-in) does not release the lease early today — there is no graceful
  shutdown hook yet — so after replacing the lease holder, canonicalization
  pauses for up to one TTL (~30s at the default 10s check interval) before the
  new holder takes over. This is a stall, never a correctness issue.
- **Rate limiting** is per-process but partitioned (see below).

## Failure modes (by design)

- **Shared store (Postgres) briefly unavailable → auth fails closed.** Login and
  authenticated requests are rejected (never bypassed) until Postgres returns.
  The canonicalization leader steps down rather than risk double-processing, and
  resumes automatically. This is a deliberate change from the old always-
  available in-memory behavior.
- **DB connection budget**: each replica opens up to `GUARDIAN_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE`
  (default 32 in prod) connections, plus the metadata pool, plus per-request
  session lookups. Coordination (sessions, challenges, the lease) does not add a
  pool of its own — it shares the **metadata pool**, so per-request auth lookups
  compete with metadata/canonicalization traffic for the same connections; size
  `GUARDIAN_METADATA_DB_POOL_MAX_SIZE` with that in mind. With N replicas the
  total can approach `N × (pools × size)`; keep it under Postgres
  `max_connections`. Prod routes through RDS Proxy by default, which pools
  server-side and absorbs much of this.

## `GUARDIAN_MAX_REPLICAS` and rate limiting

The configured global limits (`GUARDIAN_RATE_BURST_PER_SEC`,
`GUARDIAN_RATE_PER_MIN`) and the dashboard per-commitment auth budgets are
divided by `GUARDIAN_MAX_REPLICAS` so each replica enforces
`global / GUARDIAN_MAX_REPLICAS`. With round-robin distribution the fleet
aggregate stays at or below the configured global HTTP limit during steady-state
operation.

- Default = the deployment's **steady-state capacity** (Terraform): the
  greater of desired count and autoscaling max when autoscaling is enabled, or
  the desired count otherwise.
- **Drives rate-limiting only.** It has no effect on coordination mode.
- **Tolerance band**: when fewer than the steady-state maximum are running, the
  fleet over-throttles. HTTP keep-alive can also pin a client to one replica,
  throttling it at `global / capacity`. Both are accepted fail-closed outcomes.
- **Rolling deployments**: ECS may briefly run up to
  `server_deployment_maximum_percent` of the steady-state capacity. The
  aggregate allowance can rise by the same factor during that window (2× with
  the default 200%). This temporary relaxation is accepted to avoid permanent
  steady-state over-throttling.
- **Override** (`var.guardian_max_replicas`): an explicit value is clamped **up**
  to steady-state capacity. Setting it higher only over-throttles.
- **Invalid values fail fast in prod**: a set-but-unparsable or zero
  `GUARDIAN_MAX_REPLICAS` would otherwise fall back to a divisor of 1 and
  silently disable partitioning (fail-open). In the prod stage the server
  refuses to start; non-prod warns and treats it as `1`.
- **Operator login uses the same divisor**: the dashboard's per-commitment
  challenge and verification budgets use `GUARDIAN_MAX_REPLICAS`. The default
  prod divisor is 6, yielding 1 request/second and 5 requests/minute per
  endpoint on a keep-alive-pinned replica. The fleet-wide budgets can be
  overridden with
  `GUARDIAN_DASHBOARD_COMMITMENT_RATE_BURST_PER_SEC` and
  `GUARDIAN_DASHBOARD_COMMITMENT_RATE_PER_MIN`. Shares are clamped to **≥1 per
  replica** so operator login can never be fully denied. The defaults (6/second
  and 30/minute) divide exactly across the default six replicas; a custom budget
  below the divisor can exceed its nominal fleet-wide value because of the
  liveness clamp.

## Validate the coordination behavior locally

To see this contract in action before deploying — shared sessions, single-owner
lease with failover, fail-closed auth, rate-limit partitioning — run the
[horizontal-scaling guide](../guides/horizontal-scaling/README.md): two replicas
behind a round-robin proxy sharing one Postgres, all on Docker Compose.

## Filesystem backend is dev-only

The filesystem backend keeps state local to one task (and does not persist audit
events). In the prod stage the server **refuses to start** on the filesystem
backend with an actionable error. Use it only for local development / single
process.
