 *
 * Use after account recovery: normal forward sync starts from the store's
 * **global** cursor, so in a shared dirty store the cursor may already be
 * past blocks containing the recovered account's notes, and a fresh store
 * would need to replay the whole chain state to see them. The scan is
 * tag-scoped and its cost grows with the number of matching notes, not the
 * range length, which makes genesis an acceptable default lower
 * bound. The global sync height is never touched — run normal sync
 * afterwards to verify the imported notes. The store must have synced at
 * least once (`Multisig.recoverNotes` syncs the chain before this strategy
 * runs): importing a proof into a store that has never seen the chain
 * fails, and such failures surface as `failed` outcomes.
 *
 * Notes are discovered by tag only — a best-effort filter: notes sent with
 * unrelated custom tags are outside this scan's guarantee, and, like normal
 * sync, every new discovery is screened for relevance before import —
 * tag-colliding notes the account cannot consume are counted as
 * `skippedIrrelevant` instead of polluting the store. This SDK screens
 * statically against the well-known P2ID/P2IDE scripts (the WASM surface
 * does not expose the execution-based screener the Rust SDK uses), so notes
 * with custom scripts are conservatively not imported and counted as
 * `skippedUnscreenable`. Only public notes can be
 * rebuilt from chain data; private matches are counted as `skippedPrivate`
 * and are covered by the transport drain and proposal-import primitives
 * instead.
 *
 * A range dense enough to trip the node's internal pagination cap is split
 * client-side and rescanned as narrower requests; ranges that still cannot
 * be covered are reported in {@link PublicBackfillReport.uncovered} rather
 * than failing the recovery flow. This function throws only when the scan
 * range itself cannot be established (chain-tip lookup failed, an invalid
 * account ID, a block bound that is not a u32 integer, or
 * `fromBlock > toBlock`).
 *
 * Prefer the `Multisig.backfillPublicNotesByTag` convenience method, which
 * reuses the client's endpoint and retry configuration.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const report = await multisig.backfillPublicNotesByTag();
 * console.log(report.discovered, 'discovered,', report.outcomes.length, 'public');
 * await multisig.syncState(); // verifies the imported notes
