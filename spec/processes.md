# Processes

## Services overview

- **configure_account**: creates a new account by validating the provided initial state against the network, persisting it, and storing account metadata (auth, storage type, timestamps).
- **push_delta**: verifies the delta against the current state, computes the new commitment, attaches an acknowledgement, and either enqueues it as a candidate (canonicalization enabled) or immediately applies it and marks it canonical (optimistic mode).
- **get_state**: authenticates and returns the latest persisted account state.
- **get_delta**: authenticates and returns a specific delta by nonce.
- **get_delta_since**: authenticates, fetches deltas after a given nonce (excluding discarded), merges their payloads via the network client, and returns a single merged delta snapshot.

## Canonicalization

### Modes
- Candidate mode (enabled): `push_delta` stores deltas as `candidate`; a background worker promotes or discards them after verification.
- Optimistic mode (disabled): `push_delta` marks deltas as `canonical` immediately and updates state.

### Configuration
- Defaults: delay_seconds = 900 (15m), check_interval_seconds = 60 (1m).
- Per deployment configurable.

### Worker Behavior
 - Runs every `check_interval_seconds`.
 - For each account:
  - Pull all deltas and select ready candidates (candidate_at >= delay_seconds); process in nonce order.
  - Apply delta locally to compute expected state and commitment.
  - Verify on-chain commitment. If it matches `new_commitment`:
    - Persist new state (atomic with delta status update when possible).
    - Optionally update auth from chain via `should_update_auth`.
    - Set delta status to `canonical`.
  - Else set delta status to `discarded`.

  T->>W: tick(check_interval)
  W->>M: list()
  loop accounts
    W->>ST: pull_deltas_after(account_id, 0)
    W->>W: filter ready candidates (>= delay_seconds)\nsort by nonce
    loop candidates
      W->>ST: pull_state(account_id)
      W->>N: apply_delta(prev_state, delta)\n(new_state, expected_commitment)
      W->>N: verify_state(account_id, new_state)\n(on_chain_commitment)
      alt commitments match
        W->>ST: submit_state(new_state)
        W->>W: maybe update_auth(should_update_auth)
        W->>ST: submit_delta(canonical)
      else mismatch
        W->>ST: submit_delta(discarded)
      end
    end
  end
```

### State Machine
- candidate -> canonical | discarded. Discarded deltas MUST NOT be returned by default APIs.

### Failure Handling
- Transient failures SHOULD be retried with backoff. Malformed candidates SHOULD be quarantined with logs/metrics.

### Concurrency
- Processing SHOULD be per-account sequential; multi-account processing MAY be parallel with bounded concurrency.
