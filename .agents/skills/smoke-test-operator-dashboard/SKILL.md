description: Run or guide manual smoke testing of Guardian operator dashboard auth and account APIs through `examples/operator-smoke-web` and `@openzeppelin/guardian-operator-client`. Use when Codex needs to verify operator challenge signing, session login, logout, account listing, account detail, local signer behavior, local or remote Guardian targets, or workspace versus published operator client package behavior.

# Smoke Test Operator Dashboard

Use `examples/operator-smoke-web` as the primary smoke surface for operator auth and dashboard account APIs. The default path uses the browser-generated local Falcon signer, not Miden Wallet.

## Targets

| Target | Guardian | Operator client package | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Local workspace | `http://127.0.0.1:3000` | `file:../../packages/guardian-operator-client` | default for in-repo changes |
| Remote Guardian | deployed HTTP endpoint | `file:../../packages/guardian-operator-client` | verify a deployed server with current local client |
| Published client | local or remote Guardian | npm package version under test | verify a future published `@openzeppelin/guardian-operator-client` |

## Preflight

1. Check the current implementation before assuming UI labels or response shapes:
   - `examples/operator-smoke-web/src/App.tsx`
   - `examples/operator-smoke-web/src/localSigner.ts`
   - `packages/guardian-operator-client/src/http.ts`
   - `crates/server/src/api/dashboard.rs`
   - `crates/server/src/dashboard/mod.rs`
   - `docs/DASHBOARD.md`
   - `docs/PRODUCTION.md`
2. Run the focused checks:
   ```bash
   cd packages/guardian-operator-client && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build
   cd examples/operator-smoke-web && npm run typecheck && npm run build
   cargo test -p guardian-server api::dashboard::tests
   cargo test -p guardian-server dashboard::tests
   ```
3. Confirm no unrelated dirty files are needed for the smoke. Runtime state should live outside the repo unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

## Local Guardian

Start Guardian with a local JSON file containing the Falcon public keys that are allowed to log in as operators.

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/guardian-operator-smoke
printf '[]\n' > /tmp/guardian-operator-smoke/operator-public-keys.json

GUARDIAN_OPERATOR_PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE=/tmp/guardian-operator-smoke/operator-public-keys.json \
cargo run -p guardian-server --bin server
```

If port `3000` is already occupied, inspect the process and reuse it only if it was started with the needed `GUARDIAN_OPERATOR_PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE`. Otherwise stop it or use a different server port and set `VITE_GUARDIAN_TARGET`.

Optional metrics verification: add `GUARDIAN_METRICS_ENABLED=true` to the `cargo run` invocation, then after the login flow confirm the auth and dashboard counters moved:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:9464/metrics | grep -E 'guardian_(operator_auth|operator_sessions|http_requests_total)'
```

Expect `guardian_operator_auth_verifications_total{outcome="ok"}` ≥ 1 after a successful login and `guardian_http_requests_total` entries labelled with `/dashboard/*` route templates (never raw account IDs).

## Operator UI

For workspace-source smoke:

```bash
cd examples/operator-smoke-web
npm install
VITE_GUARDIAN_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:3000 npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3003
```

For remote Guardian smoke, keep the same UI and change only `VITE_GUARDIAN_TARGET`.

For published-client smoke, do not mutate the committed example dependency. Create a scratch copy outside the repo, replace `@openzeppelin/guardian-operator-client` with the published version, run `npm install`, and record `npm ls @openzeppelin/guardian-operator-client`.

## Automated Browser Run

Use the bundled script when a real browser automation pass is requested. It drives the local signer UI, logs in, lists accounts, fetches the first account detail when present, logs out, and confirms a protected request fails afterward.

The Guardian process must already be started with `GUARDIAN_OPERATOR_PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE` pointing at a writable JSON file. The script reads the UI's generated signer public key, writes the JSON array into that file, and then drives login. Because Guardian rereads the file during auth checks, the server does not need to restart when the JSON changes.

Install the automation dependency into local runtime state:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/guardian-operator-smoke-playwright
npm install --prefix /tmp/guardian-operator-smoke-playwright playwright-core
```

Run from the repo root after Guardian and the UI are listening:

```bash
GUARDIAN_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000 \
GUARDIAN_OPERATOR_SMOKE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3003/ \
GUARDIAN_OPERATOR_PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE=/tmp/guardian-operator-smoke/operator-public-keys.json \
PLAYWRIGHT_CORE_INSTALL_ROOT=/tmp/guardian-operator-smoke-playwright \
node .agents/skills/smoke-test-operator-dashboard/scripts/run-operator-smoke.mjs
```

Set `HEADLESS=false` to watch the browser. Set `CHROME_EXECUTABLE` if Chrome is not at `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`.

## Manual Flow

1. Open `http://127.0.0.1:3003/`.
2. Click `Generate local Falcon signer`.
3. Copy the UI's `Operator Public Keys JSON` value into the file used by `GUARDIAN_OPERATOR_PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE`.
4. Keep Guardian running with that file path; no restart is needed when the file content changes.
5. Confirm `GET /auth/challenge` succeeds for the displayed commitment:
   ```bash
   curl -sS -G "$GUARDIAN_URL/auth/challenge" --data-urlencode "commitment=$COMMITMENT"
   ```
6. Click `Login`.
7. Click `List accounts`.
8. If any accounts are returned, fetch one detail by pasting its account ID and clicking `Fetch account`.
9. Click `Logout`, then verify a protected action such as `List accounts` is rejected until logging in again.

Use `GUARDIAN_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000` for local runs. For deployed runs, use the deployed Guardian URL.

## Assertions

- The configured operator public key derives to the active local signer commitment in the UI.
- `Request challenge` returns `success: true` and a `signing_digest`.
- `Login` returns `operatorId` and `expiresAt`, and the browser receives a session cookie.
- `List accounts` returns `success: true`, `totalCount`, and an `accounts` array.
- `Fetch account` returns account detail for an existing account or a clear `404` for a missing account.
- `Logout` invalidates the session; protected dashboard requests should fail afterward.

## Failure Triage

- `Invalid operator credentials`: first check the server was started with `GUARDIAN_OPERATOR_PUBLIC_KEYS_FILE` pointing at the JSON file updated from the UI, then compare the UI commitment with the commitment derived by the server logs or login response.
- Challenge succeeds but login fails: verify the UI is using the same generated signer whose public key was configured in Guardian.
- `401` on account routes after login: check same-origin proxying through `/guardian` and `credentials: include`.
- Empty account list is not a failure by itself; fetch detail only when the list returns an account ID.
- A server restart clears in-memory sessions; log in again after restart.

## Documentation Impact

When operator auth, permission vocabulary, account API shapes, session/cookie behavior, local smoke setup, or deployed target assumptions change, update the matching dashboard, production, operator-client, and `examples/operator-smoke-web` docs. Use the Documentation Impact Check in `AGENTS.md` for the target files.
