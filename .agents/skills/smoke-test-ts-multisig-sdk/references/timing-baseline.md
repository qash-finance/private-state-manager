# Timing Baseline

## Use This File

Use this file as the timing reference for future smoke runs of `examples/smoke-web` and related browser-only workflows.

- Prefer exact timings from `await window.smoke.events()` whenever the step is driven by the command API.
- If the current run only has coarse manual timings for faucet, wallet, or browser actions, still record them and mark them approximate.
- When multiple clean samples exist for the same step, prefer the median rather than the single fastest run.

## Measurement Rules

- Start the timer when the final user action for the step is submitted.
- Stop the timer when the promise resolves or rejects, or when the next actionable browser state appears.
- Use `durationMs` from `window.smoke.events()` for command timings.
- Record retries separately from the eventual recovered duration.
- For canonicalization-sensitive behavior, time the lag after execute separately from execute itself.
- For proof-generation-heavy executes, label the step as proof-generation dominated.

## Comparison Rules

- `normal`: within 2x of baseline and within baseline + 60s
- `slow`: greater than 2x baseline or greater than baseline + 60s
- `severe`: greater than 3x baseline, repeated retry loops, or timeout
- Recovered failures still count as failures for canary reporting; the recovered duration is additional context, not a pass override.

## Reference Environment

- Repo: current Guardian workspace
- GUARDIAN endpoint: local HTTP `http://localhost:3000`
- Smoke harness: local isolated-browser canary harness on a free local port
- Network: Miden testnet
- Default signer source: local
- Default signature scheme: Falcon
- Timing source preference: `window.smoke.events()` first, manual stopwatch second

## Future Samples

Append future runs in the same format. Once at least three clean samples exist for a step under the same network, signer source, and signature scheme, use the median as the working baseline in reports.
