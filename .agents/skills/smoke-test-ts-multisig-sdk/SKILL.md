description: Drive manual smoke testing of the TypeScript `@openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client` SDK in this repository through the browser-only `examples/smoke-web` harness and targeted TypeScript checks. Use when Codex needs to verify browser multisig account creation, cosigner sync, proposal creation/sign/execute, offline export/import, state verification, or local/Para/Miden Wallet behavior after changes in `packages/miden-multisig-client`, `packages/guardian-client`, `examples/_shared/multisig-browser`, `examples/smoke-web`, or `examples/web`.

# Smoke Test TS Multisig SDK

Use `examples/smoke-web` as the primary smoke surface for `@openzeppelin/miden-multisig-client`. Treat `examples/web` as the parity target for the shared browser orchestration layer, not as the main canary surface.

## Quick Start

1. Read the current browser harness before assuming command names or result shapes:
   - `examples/smoke-web/src/smokeHarness.ts`
   - `examples/_shared/multisig-browser/src/multisigApi.ts`
   - `examples/_shared/multisig-browser/src/initClient.ts`
   - `examples/smoke-web/src/App.tsx`
2. Run targeted TypeScript validation before manual smoke:
   ```bash
   cd packages/miden-multisig-client && npm test
   cd examples/smoke-web && npm run typecheck && npm run build
   cd examples/web && npm run build
   ```
3. Start one GUARDIAN server from the repo root:
   ```bash
   cargo run -p guardian-server --bin server
   ```
4. Start the smoke harness:
   ```bash
   cd examples/smoke-web && npm run dev
   ```
5. Open the smoke harness in separate real browsers or fully isolated browser profiles. Do not rely on same-profile parallel tabs. Prefer Chrome + Brave or Chrome + Firefox when driving concurrent cosigners.
6. Let the page-load bootstrap settle first. If `await window.smoke.status()` is not `ready`, or you need to override the default endpoints or signer settings, initialize the session with `window.smoke.initSession(...)`.
7. Default to local signers and Falcon unless the prompt explicitly asks for ECDSA, Para, or Miden Wallet.
8. Record each browser's signer commitment from `await window.smoke.status()` before account creation.
9. Create the multisig in one browser by passing the other browsers' commitments to `createAccount`.
10. Load and sync the account in the other browsers with `loadAccount` and `sync`.
11. Choose the smallest workflow from `references/workflow-matrix.md`.
12. Record the exact browser/profile labels, endpoints, signer source, signature scheme, workflow, observed result, and timing data.
13. Compare the recorded timings with `references/timing-baseline.md`.

## Baseline Harness

Use this as the default setup unless the prompt explicitly asks for something else:

- one GUARDIAN server
- one `examples/smoke-web` dev server
- one browser or browser profile per cosigner session
- local GUARDIAN HTTP endpoint: `http://localhost:3000`
- Miden devnet RPC endpoint: `https://rpc.devnet.miden.io`
- signer source: `local`
- signature scheme: `falcon`

Treat each browser or browser profile as one cosigner. Prefer distinct browser binaries over multiple profiles when available. `initSession` clears the local IndexedDB state for that profile, so do not share one profile across concurrent cosigner sessions. Use `browserLabel` to make reports readable.

`examples/smoke-web` attempts a bootstrap on page load. For automation or console-driven smoke, check `await window.smoke.status()` before calling `initSession()`. Use `initSession()` as recovery or explicit reconfiguration, not as the automatic first step for an already-ready profile.

## Workflow Selection

- Run `browser-baseline` first when the prompt asks for a general smoke test or does not narrow the target behavior yet.
- Run `online-proposal-canary` first when the prompt asks for a default create/sign/execute canary.
- Run `payment-roundtrip-canary` when the prompt asks to test note receipt, note consumption, or self-P2ID payment flow.
- Run `switch-guardian-offline-canary` when the prompt asks to test switching providers or offline export/import/sign behavior.
- Run `para-connectivity` when signer resolution, Para integration, or ECDSA wallet flow changed.
- Run `miden-wallet-connectivity` when Miden Wallet connection, signing, or extension behavior changed.
- Run `state-verification` when commitment comparison, sync-after-execute, or account-state inspection changed.
- Run at least one Falcon pass and one ECDSA pass when key management, commitment parsing, signature encoding, or signer-source selection changed.

## Execution Rules

- Prefer `window.smoke` over DOM clicking. The UI is a status surface, not the canonical test interface.
- Prefer truly isolated browsers for concurrent cosigners. Same-browser automation is not a supported canary path unless it uses proven storage isolation.
- Use `await window.smoke.status()` after any meaningful state transition.
- Use `await window.smoke.events()` as the default command-history and timing source.
- When a `window.smoke.*` command throws an opaque JS value such as `[object Object]`, classify the failure from the newest matching `window.smoke.events()` entry rather than from the thrown value.
- If page-load bootstrap already reached `ready`, do not immediately call `initSession()` again on the same profile unless you are intentionally changing config or recovering from a failed bootstrap.
- Treat `examples/smoke-web` as the required manual smoke surface for browser SDK behavior; package tests and builds support this but do not replace it.
- Build `examples/web` whenever shared browser code changes; if the change is risky, note whether `examples/web` was also launched manually.
- Trust current source in `examples/smoke-web/src/` and `examples/_shared/multisig-browser/src/` over README text when they disagree, and note the mismatch in your result.
- Do not mark a workflow as passed unless the expected state transition is visible in `status()`, `events()`, proposal lists, notes, or explicit command output.
- For external actions that happen outside the command API, such as faucet submission or wallet modal interaction, pair the manual step with an immediate `status()` or `events()` capture.
- In the GUARDIAN-ack flow, remember that the browser client pushes the delta to GUARDIAN before the final transaction is submitted on-chain. Early canonicalization polls can therefore see the previous or zero on-chain commitment while proving or submission is still in flight.
- When `executeProposal` fails with `Refusing to overwrite local state: incoming nonce ... is not greater than local nonce ...`, treat that as a reportable pre-canonicalization state, not an immediate terminal failure. Keep syncing until the expected account state converges or the workflow times out.
- Apply the same canonicalization rule to the first post-submit `sync()` and to a newly-added cosigner's `loadAccount()`. A temporary nonce-overwrite or unauthorized failure is expected pending state by itself; the workflow only fails if later sync/load never converges.

## Timing Discipline

- Prefer the built-in `durationMs` values from `window.smoke.events()` for command timings:
  - `initSession`
  - `connectPara`
  - `connectMidenWallet`
  - `createAccount`
  - `loadAccount`
  - `registerOnGuardian`
  - `sync`
  - `fetchState`
  - `verifyStateCommitment`
  - `createProposal`
  - `signProposal`
  - `executeProposal`
  - `exportProposal`
  - `signProposalOffline`
  - `importProposal`
- Time non-command steps manually:
  - browser/profile startup
  - wallet approval modal latency
  - faucet confirmation and note visibility lag
  - canonicalization lag after execute when a newly-added cosigner is waiting to load the account
- Start manual timing when the final user action is submitted and stop when the next actionable browser or console state appears.
- If a step fails and later recovers, record both:
  - time to first failure
  - time to eventual recovery
- For proof-generation steps, explicitly note that the time is proof-generation dominated.
- Compare each captured duration with `references/timing-baseline.md`. If no baseline exists yet for that exact step, append the new timing as the first reference sample.
- Treat timing regression as reportable when a step exceeds the baseline by more than 2x or by more than 60 seconds, whichever is larger. Treat more than 3x or timeout/retry loops as severe degradation.

## High-Risk Assertions

- Verify each browser/profile is using the intended signer source and signature scheme.
- Verify the reported commitments match the expected browser session before account creation.
- Verify `createAccount` produces the expected threshold and signer set.
- Verify `loadAccount` and `sync` converge to the same account state across cosigners.
- Verify proposal IDs stay stable across export, import, offline sign, and execute.
- Verify collected vs required signatures before execute.
- Verify execute changes account state, proposal visibility, nonce-sensitive behavior, or detected vault state.
- Treat an early post-`push_delta` or post-execute on-chain `0x000...0` commitment, or a first canonicalization mismatch, as expected pending state by itself. Only treat it as a product failure if the account never converges after the proving/submission window or reaches a terminal discard/timeout.
- Verify note visibility before `consume_notes` and after self-P2ID transfer.
- Verify Para and Miden Wallet sessions expose commitment, public key, and connected state after connect.
- Verify `Switch GUARDIAN` proves real post-switch behavior, not just local proposal mutation.
- For a 2-of-2 offline `Switch GUARDIAN` run, verify both cosigners have offline-signed before execute. The proven sequence is: A exports, B imports and offline-signs, A imports B's signed JSON, A offline-signs, A imports the fully-signed JSON, then A executes.

## Canary Failure Policy

- Treat any error during setup, connect, create, load, sync, sign, execute, import, export, or post-execute sync as reportable.
- Report transient errors even if a retry or later sync succeeds.
- Treat bootstrap `ConstraintError: Key already exists in the object store` as reportable even if a later `initSession()` succeeds and the workflow recovers.
- Treat the first post-submit nonce-overwrite or unauthorized sync/load error as a recovered failure only if later sync/load proves the expected canonicalized state. If the state never converges, mark the workflow failed.
- Include the browser label, workflow step, command name, full error text, relevant event entries, whether a retry was attempted, and whether the run eventually recovered.
- Do not collapse multiple failures into one summary line; preserve the sequence so the user can see where the canary first degraded.
- If the smoke harness itself lacks a direct verification surface for a claimed SDK behavior, report that as a harness gap rather than silently marking the workflow passed.

## Reporting

Report:

- commands run
- endpoints, signer source, and signature scheme
- browser/profile labels used as cosigners
- workflows exercised
- pass/fail per workflow
- elapsed time per major step
- baseline comparison and delta for each timed step
- every observed error, even if recovered
- relevant `window.smoke.events()` entries for failures or slow steps
- whether `examples/smoke-web` and `examples/web` builds passed
- skipped coverage with reason
