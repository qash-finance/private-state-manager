# Guardian Validation Matrix

## Overview

Use this skill after the change scope is understood. Choose the minimum validation that still covers the changed behavior, then expand only when the touched path is high-risk or crosses more layers.

## Read First

Read:

- `AGENTS.md`
- [`references/command-matrix.md`](references/command-matrix.md)
- the changed files or summarized impact report

## Workflow

1. Classify the affected layer and risk.
   Decide whether the change is:
   - server-only internal
   - server contract
   - Rust client
   - TS client
   - multisig Rust
   - multisig TS
   - browser example or signer integration
   - deploy, release, or benchmark
2. Start with the package-local checks from [`references/command-matrix.md`](references/command-matrix.md).
3. Expand when any of these are true:
   - the change affects a public contract
   - the change affects auth or signature flows
   - the change affects proposal lifecycle or canonicalization
   - the change affects browser signers or user-visible examples
4. Add manual smoke when a lower-layer change is observable in `examples/demo` or `examples/smoke-web`.
5. Include a documentation check when the change affects user-visible behavior, configuration, public APIs, SDK methods, auth/signature behavior, deployment, smoke-test workflow, or example startup.
   Use the Documentation Impact Check in `AGENTS.md` for the target files.
6. Prefer existing specialized skills over duplicating their workflow.

## Guardrails

- Do not jump directly to `cargo test --workspace` unless the impact is broad or targeted checks already failed.
- Do not treat unit tests as a replacement for example smoke when the behavior is user-visible.
- When a server or client contract changes, validate at least one upstream consumer.
- Document skipped coverage with a reason instead of implying it was unnecessary.

## Specialized Skills

Use these instead of expanding this skill:

- `smoke-test-rust-multisig-sdk`
- `smoke-test-ts-multisig-sdk`
- `deploy-guardian-aws`
- `release-guardian-sdk-packages`
- `run-guardian-prod-benchmarks`

## Output Shape

Produce:

- exact ordered commands to run
- manual smoke required
- docs to check or update
- why each command is included
- what was intentionally skipped
- next expansion step if the first layer of checks fails
