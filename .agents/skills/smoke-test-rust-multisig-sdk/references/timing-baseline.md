# Timing Baseline

## Use This File

Use this file as the timing reference for future smoke runs of `guardian-demo` and related offline workflows.

- Prefer exact timings captured during the run.
- If the current run only has coarse manual timings, still record them and mark them approximate.
- When multiple clean samples exist for the same step, prefer the median rather than the single fastest run.

## Measurement Rules

- Start the timer when the final input for the step is submitted and the demo starts blocking work.
- Stop the timer when the demo prints the success line, error line, or next actionable prompt.
- Record retries separately from the eventual recovered duration.
- For canonicalization-sensitive behavior, time the lag after execute separately from the execute itself.
- For proof-generation-heavy executes, label the step as proof-generation dominated.

## Comparison Rules

- `normal`: within 2x of baseline and within baseline + 60s
- `slow`: greater than 2x baseline or greater than baseline + 60s
- `severe`: greater than 3x baseline, repeated retry loops, or timeout
- Recovered failures still count as failures for canary reporting; the recovered duration is additional context, not a pass override.

## Reference Environment

- Date: 2026-03-19
- Repo: current Guardian workspace
- GUARDIAN endpoint: local gRPC `http://localhost:50051`
- Network: Miden testnet
- Signature scheme: Falcon
- Collection method: manual live run with coarse polling, not a dedicated stopwatch

| payment-roundtrip-canary | second cosigner sign consume-notes proposal | ~1s | low | pass | Signatures reached `2/2`. |
| payment-roundtrip-canary | execute consume-notes proposal | ~120s | high | pass | Proof-generation dominated; long CPU-bound wait before success. |
| payment-roundtrip-canary | simple post-consume sync | ~1s | low | pass | Clean sync on the executing tab. |
| payment-roundtrip-canary | recovered post-consume sync after delta/store failure | ~30s | medium | recovered | Included delta commitment mismatch, store overflow panic, reinitialize, and re-pull on the other tab. |

| switch-guardian-offline-canary | offline switch proposal creation and save | ~5s | medium | pass | Exported JSON proposal created locally. |
| switch-guardian-offline-canary | import offline proposal on second cosigner | ~5s | medium | fail | Failed with `recency condition error: The client is too far behind the chain tip to execute the transaction`. |

## Future Samples

Append future runs in the same format. Once at least three clean samples exist for a step under the same network and signature scheme, use the median as the working baseline in reports.
